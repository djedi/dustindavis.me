# Hello, I'm Dustin. 👋

Here is a quick intro - all about me.

## Early Years

I was raised in rural eastern Utah (Roosevelt and Ballard). My parents were
divorced when I was in 6th grade. I lived in Salt Lake City and went to Jr. High
there (8th & 9th grade). I moved back to Roosevelt for High School.

Growing up, I was very much into sports. My dad coached football, wrestling, and
baseball. My older brother and I often got to with him and the team on long bus
trips.

In high school, I played football, basketball, and baseball. I ended my senior
year by breaking my arm while pitching in the state tournament,
[Dave Dravecky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzLtowZNrmE) style. 😬💔

I recovered and shortly after this I served a 2-year mission for
[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints](https://churchofjesuschrist.org)
in South Africa. 🇿🇦

## Family & Career

When I returned home, I went to work for
[IHC Health Plans](https://selecthealth.org/). They generously paid 80% of my
tuition at [Salt Lake Community College](http://www.slcc.edu/).

There, I met my beautiful wife Rachel. I continued to work and got to school. I
later moved my career to
[3M Health Information Systems](https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/health-information-systems-us/?utm_term=hcbg-his-na-en_us-ba-hisbrand-cpc-google-na-learn-v2-ne20-na&s_kwcid=AL!6248!3!447690737891!e!!g!!3m%20his)
and my schooling to [Weber State University](https://www.weber.edu/) where I got
my degree in Computer Information Systems. Also, thanks to 3M for their 100%
tuition reimbursement program! 💯

I've been fortunate to work for some great companies as you can see from my
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dustindavis/) profile.

I currently live in northern Utah with my wife 👧🏻 and 5 kids 🙍🏼‍♀️🙍‍♂️🙍‍♂️🙍‍♂️🙍‍♂️and our
dog 🐶.

## Why Blog?

I've been blogging for many years. More than anything, I blog for myself. I
can't tell you how often I have gone back to my own blog to remember how I did
something in the past. It is also fun to have co-workers tell me they found an
answer to a question on my blog. They say, "I should have just come asked you."
My response is, "I would have just sent you to my blog."

I hope you find something useful for your work or home life here. Feel free to
leave a comment or reach out to me on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/dustindavis/) and say hello.
