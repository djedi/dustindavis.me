## Things to do

In addition to general chat, there are lots of ways to learn and grow with
others in the KCD Community on Discord. Here are a few ideas:

### Kent's Live Streams

The `💻 Kent Live` video channel and the accompanying `#💬-kent-live` chat
channel are where I do my live streams. Most of the time my live streams are me
coding projects or working on open source.

### Kent's Office Hours

The `🏫 Kent's Office Hours` video channel and the `🏫-officehours` chat channel
are where I host my [office hours](/office-hours). This is a time twice a week
where I go live and answer any question you have. We can even share screens.
Really anything you're working on or any general questions you have can be
answered during my office hours.

### KCD Learning Clubs

When we learn together, we learn better, and that's the idea behind the
[KCD Learning Clubs](/clubs). I definitely recommend taking advantage of these
to enhance your own learning experience with my course material or anything else
you want to learn.

## Moderators

Moderators are responsible for being good examples of the
[Code of Conduct](/conduct). They politely encourage others to do so if they
notice slip-ups. Moderators are the gardeners of the Discord. If you're
interested in being a moderator, let me know in the `#📄-moderator-application`
channel.
