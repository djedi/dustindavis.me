Personal finance has always been an interest of mine - not because I'm good with
money, but probably more of the opposite. ðŸ˜¬

The term
"[debt snowball](https://www.daveramsey.com/blog/how-the-debt-snowball-method-works)"
was probably most popularized by Dave Ramsey. Put simply, it is a method paying
down your debts from the lowest balance to the highest balance. Once one debt is
paid, you put the payments you were making on that debt towards the next debt,
thus excellerating the paydown of each debt.

I've written my own budgeting software and added debt snowball type tools to
them. I've tried other debt snowball tools as well. Many out there will show you
what could happen if you follow the plan. But life doesn't really follow the
plan we always lay out.

Therefore, I wanted more of a living debt snowball where I can see where I could
have things paid off if I followed the plan, and also track what actually
happened.

So I decided to just create a google spreadsheet to track everything. It has
worked quite well.

Over a year ago, I decided to create a video tutorial to help some people who
had asked about it. I posted on YouTube. I noticed that I started getting a lot
of comments thanking me. As of this writing I have nearly 16K views - which has
to be the most views I have on a video (though I don't produce a lot of YouTube
content).

If you are interested in created a living debt snowball to track you debt
paydown, check out my video tutorial:
