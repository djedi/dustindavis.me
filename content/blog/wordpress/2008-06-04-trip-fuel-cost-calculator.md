So I was talking with a friend and we were figuring out the amount of money we
spend on a commute to see if it is worth buying a new car for the gas savings. I
was using [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com) to determine the distance
between locations. So I got the idea to create this little tool to calculate it
for me. I've been meaning to learn the
[Google Maps API](http://code.google.com/apis/maps/) anyway.

**DIRECTIONS:** Enter the current cost of fuel, your car's gas mileage and a
start and end address to get an estimate of how much you will spend on fuel for
the trip.

Fuel Cost: dollars per gallon

Your car's average gas mileage: miles per gallon (mpg)

to

Distance: miles

Fuel Cost: \$ per gallon

Gas Mileage: miles per gallon (mpg)

Cost Per Mile: \$

One way cost: **\$**

Round trip cost:** \$**

Commute: If you were to make this commute 5 days a week excluding 3 weeks for
vacation and holidays, you could expect to pay **\$** per year.
