![Raising Helen](http://images.amazon.com/images/P/B00005JN3W.01._AA125_SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg)I
was at the Library the other day to pick up a book I had on hold. I always like
to walk by the DVD section to see if there is anything good available. Hey, its
a free DVD rental!

Well I saw Raising Helen and figured my wife would like to watch it. She really
liked _How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days_.

I have to admit I really liked it. I was completely surprised. I just figured it
would be a silly comedy. Who knew it would involve such tragedy. Maybe I'm just
turning into a
[chick flick kind of guy](http://www.nerdydork.com/?s=chick+flick), but I would
recommend this movie for a "feel good" evening.
