It's my wife's birthday today. She got a call from the mortgage company we went
through to buy our house. We haven't heard from them since a month after we
signed the papers and they sold our note. So the call really came as quite a
surprise to my wife. It went something like this:

Axiom: "This is Axiom financial. We are just calling to wish you a happy
birthday."

Wife: "Uh, OK."

A: "So how is your family?"

W: "Goooood."

(More awkward attempts at conversation)

A: "So, do you need any money?"

W: "Excuse me?"

A: "Well, we do second mortgages..."

Can you believe this marketing technique?! Happy birthday, want to get in debt?
Lown down, dirty, rotten...
