may great features that make an iPod so much better to job with than say a
portable DVD player, or the old reliable
[Sony Walkman](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSony-WM-FX197-AM-Cassette-Walkman%2Fdp%2FB0007RPW3Q%2Fsr%3D1-1%2Fqid%3D1171035534%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Delectronics&tag=ipod-zod-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325).
First of all you can hold infinitely more songs. DVD players had the advantage
over cassette players allowing you to skip songs, but had the drawback of
skipping - especially when jogging. You don't have to worry about an iPod
skipping.

Some believe that iPods have no moving parts. This is actually not true. iPods
contain mini hard drives. Unfortunately, all that jarring from jogging can
affect you iPod in the long run, but I wouldn't be too concerned.

If you jog quite often and are worried about protecting your valuable electronic
device, you may want to consider the
[iPod Shuffle](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Furl%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps%26field-keywords%3Dipod%2Bshuffle%26Go.x%3D0%26Go.y%3D0%26Go%3DGo&tag=ldspdacom-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=ipod-zod-20&amp;amp;l=ur2&=1)
or another
[portable MP3 player](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26keywords%3Dportable%2520mp3%2520player%2520flash%2520memory%26rh%3Di%253Aaps%252Ck%253Aportable%2520mp3%2520player%2520flash%2520memory%252Ci%253Aelectronics%26page%3D1&tag=ipod-zod-20&=ur2&=1789&=9325)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=ipod-zod-20&amp;l=ur2&=1)
that uses flash memory rather than a mini hard drive.

Flash member cannot hold near the amount of a mini hard drive, but they have no
moving parts and therefor will last longer over time.
