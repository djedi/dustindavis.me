In the year 2005, the Lord came unto Noah, who was now living in the United
States, and said, "Once again, the earth has become wicked and overpopulated,
and I see the end of all flesh before me. Build another Ark and save 2 of every
living thing along with a few good humans."

He gave Noah the blueprints, saying, "You have 6 months to build the Ark before
I will start the unending rain for 40 days and 40 nights."

Six months later, the Lord looked down and saw Noah weeping in his yard but no
Ark.

"Noah!" He roared, "I'm about to start the rain! Where is the Ark?"

"Forgive me, Lord," begged Noah, "but things have changed. I needed a building
permit. I've been arguing with the inspector about the need for a sprinkler
system. My neighbours claim that I've violated the neighbourhood zoning laws by
building the Ark in my yard and exceeding the height limitations. We had to go
to the Development Appeal Board for a decision.

Then the Department of Transportation demanded a bond be posted for the future
costs of moving power lines and other overhead obstructions, to clear the
passage for the Ark's move to the sea. I told them that the sea would be coming
to us, but they would hear nothing of it.

Getting the wood was another problem. There's a ban on cutting local trees in
order to save the spotted owl. I tried to convince the environmentalists that I
needed the wood to save the owls -- but no go!

When I started gathering the animals, I got sued by an animal rights group. They
insisted that I was confining wild animals against their will. They argued the
accommodation was too restrictive, and it was cruel and inhumane to put so many
animals in a confined space.

Then the EPA ruled that I couldn't build the Ark until they'd conducted an
environmental impact study on Your proposed flood.

I'm still trying to resolve a complaint with the Human Rights Commission on how
many minorities I'm supposed to hire for my building crew.

Immigration and Naturalization is checking the green-card status of most of the
people who want to work.

The trades unions say I can't use my sons. They insist I have to hire only Union
workers with Ark-building experience.

To make matters worse, the IRS seized all my assets, claiming I'm trying to
leave the country illegally with endangered species.

So, forgive me, Lord, but it would take at least 10 years for me to finish this
Ark."

Suddenly the skies cleared, the sun began to shine, and a rainbow stretched
across the sky.

Noah looked up in wonder and asked, "You mean You're not going to destroy the
world?".

"No," said the Lord. "The government beat me to it."
