![The Mountain](http://media.bonnint.net/slc/2/277/27727.jpg)It's that time of
year again. My contract is up on
[DIRECTV](http://www.expertsatellite.com/index.php?exp_affil=777), so I'm
preparing to make the switch to Dish Network for some new DVR's and
[more channels](http://www.direct-vs-dish.com/compare.php) for the money.

I'm a bit hesitant though. Even though I'm a big fan of satellite television,
I'm actually considering
[Comcast](http://www.buycomcast.com/index.aspx?img=108&kbid=5005&cpao=115&cpca=mam&cpag=taf&aid=5005).
Why? Well, it's been over a year, and still the
[Mountain (mtn)](http://themtn.cstv.com/) is only available on Comcast. Now, was
this some ploy by Comcast to get more subscribers? So what's a guy to do, be
stubborn and say no to the monopoly, or enjoy some BYU & Utah Football?

Decisionsâ€¦ Decisionsâ€¦

I guess for now, I can do my part by signing
[online petitions](http://www.petitiononline.com/MWCSPORT/petition.html) and
making my voice heard. I will be sure to tell DIRECTV that the reason I am
leaving is because they won't offer mtn. ;)
