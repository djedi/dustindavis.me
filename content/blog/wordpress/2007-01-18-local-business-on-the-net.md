There are lots of local business on the Internet. I think every business should
have a home page. It's basically like have a really cheap glorified yellow page
listing - but so much more. You can share everything about your business and
even automate some of your business processes.

There was one occasion where we wanted to get our carpets cleaned. I started
with Google, but couldn't fine any local results. Then I turned to the yellow
pages and looked at each of the ones that had websites. When I found one I liked
I made the appointment. The person on the phone asked why I selected them. I
told her because they had the best website (and believe me, that was not saying
much!).

So if you own a local business, make sure you have a website. If you have a
website, maybe you could benefit from
