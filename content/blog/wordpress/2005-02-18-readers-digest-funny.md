I couldn't decide whether to go to Salt Lake City or Denver for vacation, so I
called the airlines to get prices. "Airfare to Denver is
$300," the cheery salesperson replied. "And what about Salt Lake City?" "We have a really great rate to Salt Lake -- $99,"
she said. "But there is a stopover." "Where?" "In Denver," she said.
