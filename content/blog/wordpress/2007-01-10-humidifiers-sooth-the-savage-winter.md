the winter, the air can get very dry. I don't know if it is true in various
parts of the country, but it is certainly true here in Utah, where the climate
is very dry as it is. This will often lead to extra dry skin and lips, and sore
throats. But funny enough, what I hate most is all the static that builds up
when I take off my clothes at night! Being the hairy man I am, It seems like I'm
in the midst of an electrical storm when I take off a t-shirt!I've found a way
to sooth the effects of the dry air. It's simple enough. I use a humidifier. My
wife prefers the hot air humidifier, and I prefer the cold. We used to argue
about it often, then I asked my doctor and he said they essentially do the same
thing and it doesn't really matter which you use. If you don't know of the
different types of humidifiers available, I suggest checking out the
[complete guide to buying a house humidifier](http://www.humidifierinformation.com/).

If your as cheap as I am, just buy the cheapest model at
[Wal-Mart](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=qcwgUPbTBck&offerid=123427.5131254&type=2&subid=0)![](http://ad.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/show?id=qcwgUPbTBck&bids=123427&type=2&subid=0),
the plan on replacing it every year or so. One day, I think I will have one
built in to our central air, which I hear is really nice.
