[DVD Anthology](http://dvdanthology.com) is becoming pretty popular as it is
nearing 900 members. When I was looking for a domain name for the site, I wanted
[DVDFriends.com](http://dvdfriends.com), but it was not available at the time.
I've sinced purchased it. I plan on basically creating a site like DVD
Anthology, but with some new features and such.

I've posted a project on [Nerdlance.com](http://www.nerdlance.com) to create a
logo for the new site. I put the budget at
$100, but I don't expect to pay more than $50 since I've pretty much explained
exactly what I what with a sketch. if you're a graphics artist, feel free to bid
on the project at [http://www.nerdlance.com/p65](http://www.nerdlance.com/p65)

If you want to see a mock-up of my logo idea, see
[DVDFriends.com](http://dvdfriends.com).
