Yesterday I was in my office doing some homework, when I overheard my wife
talking to her sister. She was going on and on about how wonderful our DVR
system is. I thought it was rather humorous.

<!-- more -->

Yes, I love my new DVR! What is a DVR? It is a Digital Video Recorder. I'm sure
you've heard of [TiVo](http://www.tivo.com) right? Same thing.

I have [Dish Network](http://www.direct-vs-dish.com/dish-network/). I recently
moved houses. They have a deal that allows you to leave your old dish and they
will bring a new one to your new home for free. Rather than just calling and
getting a new Dish, I told them I saw a flyer that offered DVR. For just \$5.00
more a month for the DVR service fee, I got a new DVR receiver and dish to go
with it. My wife was frustrated with me at the time as she felt it was just
another one of my toys to confuse her. I think for the first couple weeks she
absolutely refused to pause the TV, rewind it, or record anything on it just out
of spite. I used it though.

Now it seems my wife is Dish salesperson. She tells everyone why they NEED a DVR
system. We have a very strong willed, temper throwing, bull-headed, stubborn,
sweet little princess 2 year old daughter. Some might say she has hit her
"terrible two's." :D She is also in the process of potty training. So, I think
you might be able to understand how easy it is to be pulled away from
[CSI](http://www.cbs.com/primetime/csi). Now we can simply pause it, do whatever
we need to, and sit back down to enjoy. We actually prefer it this way because
when we come back 5 minutes later, we can blow through 5 minutes worth of
commercials and then watch CSI uninterrupted!

Another sales pitch I've heard my wife make to her mom and sister is during the
day when she wants to watch
[30 minute meals with Rachel Ray](http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/show_tm/0,1976,FOOD_9997,00.html),
she can set a timer to have it automatically turn to that station when it
starts. We had that feature with our old Dish Network receiver, but now, we can
set the timer to record a show. My mom has had DVR with Dish Network for a
couple years now. Often I'll go over to her house in the afternoon and she's
watching [Leno](http://www.nbc.com/The_Tonight_Show_with_Jay_Leno/). I guess she
never wants to stay up that late, so she just has her DVR programmed daily to
record Jay. I'm almost positive she does the same with
[Oprah](http://www.oprah.com/) & [Dr. Phil](http://www.drphil.com/).

Back to my sweet little two year old. She has a few shows of her own she really
loves such as

Blue's Clues, [Dora the Explorer](http://www.nickjr.com/), and
[The Wiggles](http://www.thewiggles.com.au/) (sometimes I like to replace my
[Tae-Bo](http://dvdanthology.com/search.php?sq=tae-bo) with the Wiggles for an
intense cardio workout :D). The times that she likes to watch them are rarely in
line with the times they are actually on. Have you ever priced
[children's DVD's](http://dvdanthology.com/search.php?sq=blue's+clues)? Ouch!
Not worth it when they are easily scratched as soon as you turn your and you
child is pushing it across the floor. Now I just scroll through the schedules
and set a few times and she has a collection of shows she can watch whenever.

Lastly, for me, sports. Yeah, you know. How many times have you wanted to watch
the top ten plays of the week again on
[Sports Center](http://espn.go.com/thisissportscenter/) without having to wait
for the next episode? Just rewind it. Whenever the Jazz play, my parents will
set the timer to record the first quarter and start watching that in the second
quarter. That way they can see the whole game and blow through the commercials.
It's great to rewind and do your own play by play commentary and prove that yes,
it was a cheap foul!

Like I said, I love my DVR system.

By the way, if you're at all interested in all this, Dish Network is currently
offering the DVR system free for new installations, or if you
[prefer DIRECTV](http://www.direct-vs-dish.com/), you can get the ever popular
TiVo. I really don't know the difference between the two, but I'm sure they are
more similar than they are different.
