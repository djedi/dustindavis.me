This is interesting. I keep getting emails from a group of people that have
mistakenly entered my email address in their CC field. When I look at it though,
it is not my address, it is missing the period in between my first and last
name. When I was looking at this, I saw a link that said, oddly enough, \"Yes,
this is you.\" Upon clicking the \"Learn More\" link I found this information:

!["gmail"]("http://www.nerdydork.com/wp-content/images/yes%20you.png")

**Am I receiving someone else\'s email?** Gmail doesn\'t recognize dots (.) as
characters within a username. This way, you can add and remove dots to your
username for desired address variations. messages sent to
your.username@gmail.com and y.o.u.r.u.s.e.r.n.a.m.e@gmail.com are delivered to
the same inbox, since the characters in the username are the same.

Keep in mind that hyphens (-) and underscores (\_) can\'t be used in a Gmail
address. Also, usernames are case insensitive, so it doesn\'t matter if you
enter upper case or lower case letters.

If you created your account with a dot in your username and you wish you
hadn\'t, you can change your \'Reply-to address.\' To change your reply-to
address:

1. Click \'Settings\' at the top of any Gmail page.
2. Enter your username@gmail.com without a dot in the \'Reply-to address\'
   field.
3. Click \'Save Changes.\'

When you log in to Gmail, you need to enter any dots that were originally
defined as part of your username.

For some reason I thought that when I initially signed up for gmail that
dustindavis was taken so I selected dustin.davis. I guess dustin.davis just
looked better to me
