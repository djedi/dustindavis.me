My daughter came home from pre-school singing a turtle song with a familiar
tune. The tune came from a song I used to hear a lot back when I was in the
second grade. I tried to google it to find the "official" lyrics, only to learn
there seems to be no official lyrics - every
[version](http://www.kayshapero.net/child2.htm) I
[found ](http://kilowan.wordpress.com/2006/09/02/skeeters-and-the-bed-bugs/)on
the internet seemed to be noticibly different. So, I decided to post it as I
remember it:

<blockquote>
I woke up Sunday morning
I looked up on the wall
The beetles (or skeeters) and the bed bugs
Were playing a game of ball

The score was six to nothing The beetles (or skeeters) were ahead The bed bugs
hit a home run And knocked me out of bed!

I'm singing Eenie meenie and a... Minie mo mo mo mo Catch a whippa-whoppa By the
toe, and if he... Hollers hollers hollers Let him go. I'm singing Eenie meenie
and a... Minie mo!

I wend downstairs for breakfast They served me bacon and eggs I ate up all the
bacon The eggs ran down my legs!

I'm singing Eenie meenie and a... Minie mo mo mo mo Catch a whippa-whoppa By the
toe, and if he... Hollers hollers hollers Let him go. I'm singing Eenie meenie
and a... Minie mo!

My mother is a baker My father cuts up meat And I'm a little hot-dog Running
down the street!

I'm singing Eenie meenie and a... Minie mo mo mo mo Catch a whippa-whoppa By the
toe, and if he... Hollers hollers hollers Let him go. I'm singing Eenie meenie
and a... Minie mo!

I jumped into the sewer And that's where I will die Some people call it murder
But I call it sewer-cide!

I'm singing Eenie meenie and a... Minie mo mo mo mo Catch a whippa-whoppa By the
toe, and if he... Hollers hollers hollers Let him go. I'm singing Eenie meenie
and a... Minie mo!
