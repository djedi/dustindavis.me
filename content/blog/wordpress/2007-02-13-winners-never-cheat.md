[![](http://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/P/0131863665.01._SCMZZZZZZZ_V38088252_.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0131863665/ldspdacom-20?tag=ldspdacom-20)I
first noticed this book while I was browsing around Barnes & Noble. I wanted to
get it, but I opted to check it out at the library instead.

I blew threw this book. It is such an easy read and it held my interest the
whole way through. Now, I consider myself different for even having an interest
in this book because I think the people who NEED to read this book would never
even consider it. Jon Huntsman calls for a return of old time values where your
word is your bond and you consider giving more than hoarding.

It was an excellent book and it helped me look at all aspects of my life and
work and find room for improvement throughout. I highly recommend it to everyone
with a conscience.
