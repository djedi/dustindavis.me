One of my favorite tools on Windows is
[Enounce MySpeed](http://www.enounce.com/myspeed). It basically allows you to
incread the playback speed of online videos - or any flash content really. This
is great for watching long instuctional type vidoes.

Unfortunately MySpeed is not available on Ubuntu Linux. I've had to come up with
a work-around process to speed up videos. That work-around is what I'm going to
share here.

The first think I do is download the video that I want to speed up. This is made
easy with the [Video DownloadHelper](http://www.downloadhelper.net/)
[plugin for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3006/).

After downloading the video, I play it with the
[VLC media player](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/), which you can easily download
in the Ubuntu Software Center.

![](https://nerdydork.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Selection_001.png)In the
lower right hand corder of VLC you will see 1.00x. Click this and you will then
have a slider to adjust the playback speed.
