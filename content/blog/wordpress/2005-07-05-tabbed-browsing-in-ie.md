I've tried a number of tools such as Crazy Browser or Avant Browser, but I've
wondering when Microsoft would create their own tabbed browsing tool for
Internet Explorer. Well, I downloaded a desktop search tool that M\$ has
recently released and I was surprised to find that it also installed an MSN
search bar which includes tabbed browsing features. Cool! I'll stick with
FireFox though! :)
