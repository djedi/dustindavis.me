After doing maintenance on a few PHP projects, I've come to the conclusion that
I really need to use frameworks for medium to big projects. After looking at a
few frameworks in a few different languages, I've run across a pretty cool
website at [sucks-rocks.com](http://sucks-rocks.com).

I plugged in a number of popular web languages and frameworks just to get an
idea of what people are saying about them. The results are pretty interesting.
First take a look at some
[language comparisons](http://sucks-rocks.com/rate/PHP/Perl/Python/Ruby/VB.NET/C%23/Java).
Then, look at some
[framework comparisons](http://sucks-rocks.com/rate/Maypole/CodeIgniter/Pylons/CherryPy/Grails/Django/Symfony/CakePHP/Ruby+on+Rails/Flex/Zend/Zope/Zend+Framework/Struts/ASP.NET/).
And finally, I thought I'd check out some
[Javascript libraries](http://sucks-rocks.com/rate/mochikit/jquery/script.aculo.us/scriptaculous/dojo).

Conclusion: With Web 2.0 design, you can't go wrong by picking a good framework
and throwing in some ajax.
