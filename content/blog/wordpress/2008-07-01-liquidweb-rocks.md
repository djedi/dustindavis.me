I just need to give some props to
[Liquidweb](http://www.liquidweb.com/?RID=redseam). I have a cPanel VPS account
there. I have been impressed with their "Heroic Support". Recently though, they
went above and beyond.

I've been having PHP mid career crisis of sorts and been looking at other
languages and frameworks. Django and Python have caught my eye. I started
developing an application, but I wanted to first see if I could deploy it to my
server before I got too far into it.

I strugged for 3 or 4 days trying. I spent a lot on time on IRC and they guys
there were quite helpful, but they couldn't figure out why my deployment was not
working either. Finally, after hitting a brick wall, I submitted a support
ticket. Because it was 3 party software I wasn't expecting much.

I was blown away by the level of service I got. The first person had never heard
of Django, but she read the documentation on how to install it and pointed me to
the right files to edit. Later she passed me on to someone else who was more
familiar with Django. In all I got responses from 4 different people who worked
on this issue. They got it up and running and explained what they did. Kudos to
Liquidweb.
