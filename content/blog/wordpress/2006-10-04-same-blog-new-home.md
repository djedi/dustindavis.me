OK, this is the second time I've changed the name of my blog, but this time I
think it will stick. Why? Because I've found a new home! Rather than keeping it
on a sub-domain, I've got my own domain for my highly refreshed blog. I really
never thought it would come to this.

Why Nerdy Dork? Because
[I am Tri-Lamb Material](http://www.nerdydork.com/im-a-nerd-and-a-dork.html)
according to this
[Nerd, Geek, Dork test](http://www.okcupid.com/tests/take?testid=9935030990046738815).

Now, we'll see if anyone even reads this blog. I rarely get comments anymore
anyway :(
