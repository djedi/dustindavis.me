I written
[a post like this before](https://dustindavis.me/my-applications.html), but that
was 2009 and I was using Windows 7. I have since switched to Linux and then OSX,
so I figured it would be a good time to visit the topic again.

Here are the applications and tools I use:

- [PyCharm](http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/): I spend the majority of my days
  in this application. For a long time I wasn't a fan of IDE's, but this one
  does so much for me and makes me a better programmer. I can't imagine working
  without it now.
- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/): My browser of tools.
  I guess really this is the most used app on my computer. I love the developer
  tools as well. It took me a while to give up Firebug, but once I did, there
  has been no reason to open other browsers.
- [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/): I prefer this terminal app to the default in
  OSX.
- [Tower](http://www.git-tower.com/): I jump back and forth between GUI and CLI
  for git, but I'll be honest, I'm a GUI kind of guy and I love using tower -
  especially for reviewing code changes before I commit.
- [DiffMerge](http://www.sourcegear.com/diffmerge/): This is the merge tool I
  have integrated with Tower. It makes merging conflicts so much easier. Until
  [BeyondCompare](http://www.scootersoftware.com/moreinfo.php) becomes available
  for the [Mac](http://www.scootersoftware.com/support.php?zz=kb_mac), this is
  the best I could find.
- [PgAdmin3](http://www.pgadmin.org/download/macosx.php),
  [Base](http://menial.co.uk/base/), [Sequel Pro](http://www.sequelpro.com/):
  GUI tools for working with databases.
- [LimeChat](http://limechat.net/mac/): For all my
  [IRC](https://dustindavis.me/setting-up-a-znc-irc-bouncer.html) communication.
- [Adium](http://adium.im/): For instant messaging (Google Talk mainly)
- [Tweetbot](http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/): Yes, I bought a twitter
  client. It is that good.
- [Jing](http://www.techsmith.com/jing.html): For quickly making screenshots and
  screencasts under 5 minutes to use add clarity to
  [Trac](http://trac.edgewall.org/) &
  [YouTrack](http://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack/index.jsp) tickets.
- [Camtasia](http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia-mac-features.html) or
  [ScreenFlow](http://www.telestream.net/screenflow/overview.htm): For more
  professional screencasts. (Camtasia for Mac is not nearly as good as Camtasia
  for Windows)
- [Photoshop](http://www.photoshop.com/),
  [Illustrator](http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html),
  [InDesign](http://www.adobe.com/products/indesign.html),
  [Pixelmator](http://www.pixelmator.com/): Image editing tools as needed.
- [Optimal Layout](http://most-advantageous.com/optimal-layout/): To help manage
  my window layout.
- [MySpeed](http://www.enounce.com/myspeed-mac-getting-started): For speeding up
  online videos.
- [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com): If you use more than one computer you
  should have a dropbox account.
- [Evernote](http://evernote.com/): I use it, but not as much as everyone raves
  about it.
- [Picasa](http://picasa.google.com/): For managing all my personal photos. Love
  that I have the same experience on Windows, Linux & Mac.

There are other apps, but nothing I use enough to write home about.

Also, there are web apps I use quite frequently that should also get a shout
out:

- [Inzolo](https://inzolo.com): My virtual envelope system of budgeting. I
  wouldn't generally toot my own horn, but I use this almost daily. I may be
  moving to a [new budgeting system](http://envelopebudget.com) soon though ;)
- [BitBucket](http://bitbucket.org): Not quite as popular as GitHub, but I love
  that they have free private repos! Plus they seem to be improving month after
  month. No regrets moving all my private repos here.
- [GitHub](http://github.com): Our Git repository of choice at work.
- [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com): Generally I find the answers to
  programming questions here first.
- Then there are the old standbys: Gmail, Google, YouTube, Facebook, etc.
