President Hinckley has
[challenged members](http://www.lds.org/library/display/0,4945,2043-1-3156-1,00.html)
of the church to read the Book of Mormon completely by the end of the year. I've
created this spreadsheet to track my progress.

![BOM Reading Goal](http://nerdydork.com/images/bom_status_snip.png)

Basically, I've listed each chapter in the Book of Mormon and how many verses
are in it. To the left I've listed how many of those verses I have read. Below
each chapter is a summary of how many chapters I have left to read, the date I
want to read them all, how many days I have left to do so, How many chapters I
have to read each day, and finally, how far behind (or ahead) of my goal I am to
read two chapters per day.

If you want to use this spreadsheet for yourself, feel free to
[download it here](http://nerdydork.com/images/BookofMormon.xls).
