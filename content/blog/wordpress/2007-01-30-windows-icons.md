If you've ever tried to find some good windows icons for your applications you
may have experiences frustrations sorting through all the junk on the internet.
Did you know that if you have Visual Studio .NET installed, you likely have all
the common icons that you need?

Take a look in your file system for this folder: C:\Program Files\Microsoft
Visual Studio 8\Common7\VS2005ImageLibrary

You're welcome! ;)
