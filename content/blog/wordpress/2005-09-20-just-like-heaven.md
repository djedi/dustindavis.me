My wife and I finally got to go on a date (without the kids) last weekend. It
had been about 3 months. We were going to go see _The Brothers Grimm_, but _Just
Like Heaven_ had just opened and I was curious to see Jon Heder's (a.k.a.
Napoleon Dynamite) next performance.

I was very pleasantly surprised. From the preview, I had no idea what the movie
was about. I thought some guy was going to fall in love with a ghost or
something. But there was so much more to it than that. What a great story. I
must really be into chick flicks or something because this was one the most
enjoyable movies I have watched all year.

I laughed throughout the movie and my wife cried. Sure, my eyes watered a bit,
but I never cried. My wife even cried after the movie while telling her sister
on the phone she should go see it. This will surely be in my DVD collection once
it is released.
