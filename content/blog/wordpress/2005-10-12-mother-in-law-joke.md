A Man, his wife, and mother-in-law went on vacation to the Holy Land. While they
were there the mother-in-law passed away. The undertaker told them, "You can
have her shipped home for
$5,000, or you can bury her here in the Holy Land for $150."

The man thought about it and told him he would just have her shipped home.

The undertaker asked, "Why? Why would you spend
$5,000 to ship your mother-in-law home, when it would be wonderful to spend only $150?"

The man said, "A man died here nearly 2000 years ago, he was buried here and
three days later he rose from the dead. I just can't take that chance."
