If you are into affiliate marketing at all, or have been in the past year, you
probably remember the whole
"[The Death Of Adsense](http://www.thedeathofadsense.com/cgi-bin/go.cgi/4909)"
report that came out last year. In was in the middle of these reports that I
first heard about [John Jonas](http://jonasblog.com). He did a marketing call
with Scott Boulch, the author of The Death Of Adsense. I listened to it on my
iPod while working out during lunch one day. I couldn't believe how much
information John was sharing on that call and how straight up honest he was. I
agreed spot on with everything he said - especially his product reviews. After
listening to that call, I found his website and email list
["What's crap and what's not."](http://www.whatscrapandwhatsnot.com/) It was
refreshing to say the least.

I was especially intrigued by an email John sent to his list back on December
2nd. He had initially send an email hyping Competition Dominator, but came back
saying it was crap based on further use. I find some of the comments left to
this email humorous. I think it was mostly people who wasted their money on the
product just chirping to try to justify their purchase to themselves.

I found this comment especially humorous and ironic:

(BTW, that post is a PR2 and the site as a whole is a PR4)

Well, John finally released his product. Again, I was surprised at the detail he
showed in his videos - especially how to do the stuff manually. From a web
programmer and automation engineer it looked to me like he was giving away the
farm before he even released the product. He actually showed you how he made the
software work! I think this was to prove how legit the software really is - no
false claims, no smoke & mirrors.

I waited for the released and when I saw that it was nearly \$300 per month, I
can't say I was surprised. I figured it might be as much because if used
properly, this software could easily pay for itself with minimal effort - unlike
most software that makes that claim. I had the opportunity to order it, but I
didn't. But let me tell you a little bit more about myself to explain why...

I think I first got started with Internet marking back in 2003. I had a few
websites and I was even selling Palm & Pocket PC software to a niche market (but
I can't say I even know what "niche market" meant at that time). I had a
co-worker that started telling me about the money he was making on the side with
various things he was doing. Ultimately, he started making HUGE money using
Google Adwords. He referred me to the Google Cash book by Chris Carpenter. I
bought it and read it. I spend a few months trying this stuff out. I racked up
thousands of dollars on my credit card, but the affiliate commissions I got
seemed to barely break even. I think out of all the campaigns I tried only one
or two of them made fairly decent returns - or so I thought. As I was trying
results I later learned that most of the sales for my best profiting campaign
were fraudulent so I never got paid. I lost big time. I cut my losses and
figured this system is just not for me and gave up on it - even though my friend
was making 5 figures a month with it.

I never really lost interest with Adwords though. With the Death of Adsense
report, I learned how I could better improve reporting. I tried again, but still
I could never seem to find a profitable campaign I was always losing money. Most
of all, I didn't want to get out my credit card again. I was on cash only basis
from here on out!

So in essence, this is the reason I did not buy John's software. I simply didn't
have the cash on hand in my "business" account. Everything I do on the side I
keep in a separate account. This is sort of my "playground" to earn extra money.
We have a baby on the way due in September and my wife (who doesn't understand
much of this stuff anyway) was not very keen on the idea of me spending that
much money on software I couldn't very well explain to her.

On day 2 I was surprised that there were open spots still available for
UnderCoverProfits (UCP). I sent John a message and asked out of curiosity how
many seats were still available. There were only 6 left! I explained that I
couldn't afford it but I thought about writing my own version that essentially
did the same. I was surprised at his response. He was positive and encouraging -
even offering tips and suggestions!

Well it took only 3 days to write the features that I saw on John's videos.
Granted, I don't have all the features, I don't have keywords sorted by
campaigns, and I don't have the ability to find other ad campaigns existing for
a certain clickbank user. But I have the core functionality that makes the
software so valuable. In his videos, John used "panic attack" to demonstrate one
profitable campaign he found. Here are my results after 12 days of monitoring
(click to see full size):

[![Panic Attack](https://dustindavis.me/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/panic-attack.png)](https://dustindavis.me/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/panic-attack.png)

I don't have a full month of data for any keywords yet, but I got excited with
results I have already started seeing so I tried out some ads. The first one I
tried was profitable! It's a ClickBank product and honestly, I have never had
success with any ClickBank products - even though that is what all the gurus
rave about.

As you can see from the screen shot below, I'm actually getting some "bars" in
ClickBank now!

[![ClickBank](https://dustindavis.me/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/clickbank.thumbnail.png)](https://dustindavis.me/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/clickbank.png)

On that first campaign I've tried, I've _**netted**_ \$180 in 5 days. I
understand all the tracking techniques and all the principles behind tracking,
testing, landing pages, etc. My problems has always been to know what products
will actually make more than I have to spend on them to get the traffic. Now,
thanks to John, I have a tool that will help.

It's funny, when I told my wife about the results. She said, "maybe you should
buy his software now." It's certainly a good idea. Like I said, I don't have all
the features John has. My biggest concern is that I'm running this on my own
hosting account. I have to query Google every day for each of my keywords. John
has 30 servers and 1500 IP addresses set up. Obviously he has a safer and more
reliable system. Well, now its obviously a bit too late even if I wanted to. The
seats are full so I would have to get on the waiting list like everyone else.

So to sum up this post, thank you John for awesome software you have released to
the public. Even though I have not purchased it, your help and suggestions have
gotten me back in the game after two years on the disabled list!
