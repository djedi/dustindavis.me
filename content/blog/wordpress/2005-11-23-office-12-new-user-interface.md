![Office 12](http://www.microsoft.com/office/images/preview/61798a.jpg)"This is
probably the biggest release ever for Office."

Office 12 has a completely new interface. I know what you're thinking... "No!
Leave it alone!" Well, you may actually like these new changes.

We were all happy to see the death of Clippy - that annoying paper clip telling
you what to do. Now we may see the death of classic toolbar File, Edit, View...
etc. Now we may be looking at "ribbons", "galleries", and "floaties". Don't get
to used to the terms, because they may just be codenames for now.

If you want to learn more and preview the new features, check out the following
