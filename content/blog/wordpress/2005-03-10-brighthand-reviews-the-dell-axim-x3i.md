I just purchased a Dell Axim X3i on Ebay. I decided to find out some more info
after the fact. I came across this review on brighthand. The reviewer appears to
be LDS :) How do I know? Check out the Switcher Bar screenshot!

Switcher Bar Though Microsoft has ironed a lot of the minor inconveniences out
of Windows Mobile 2003, there are still a few that continue to irritate users.
The most notable of these is the fact that tapping on the X in the
upper-right-hand corner of the screen doesn't actually close an application, as
it does in Windows. Instead, it is minimized and continues to run in the
background, using up system resources. You can manually close apps but it is way
more complicated than it ought to be.

Therefore Dell has been kind enough to include on the X3i a handy application
called Switcher Bar. This puts a small icon at the top of the screen that, when
tapped on, displays a list of all running applications. This allows you to
switch between them or, even better, quickly shut them down.

Of course, Switcher Bar isn't the only application that does this but it's nice
that Dell went ahead and bundled it with this Pocket PC.
