I often get new ideas for projects and websites. It then becomes a challenge to
figure out how much work I would have to put in to this new idea to make it
successful, and, if that work is even worth the effort. Sometimes, even if it is
worth the effort, I simply don't have time to actually do it.

I've found an effective way to help myself out though. I've made money on
freelance portals and even hired people for freelance work. One thing I found
that has become quite helpful in determining the effort and value of my new
ideas is to post them on these freelance boards. Many times I will post projects
that I have no intension of even hiring someone for. I just want to get an idea
of how much it will cost me to hire someone vs. how much time it will take me to
do it. My time may be more valuable than the cost of hiring someone.

I have _NOT_ found negative reprocussions to doing this. At first I thought,
"what if the freelance boards start to notice that I never hire anyone?" What do
they care? It's a win-win situation. You get bids to estimate project costs, and
their freelance portal has more visitors and updated content for the search
engines. The only ones that really have anything to lose are the freelancers
that take the time to review your project and post a bid. To them, I apologize.
But honestly, I doubt many of them have high hopes in the first place.
Especially if you have over a hundred bidders fighting for your project. Odds
are slim they would have gotten it in the first place, and still they are okay
with taking the time for these type of odds.

So, for your next project or new idea. Go post it free at
[Nerdlance.com](http://www.nerdlance.com). Posting is free and there is no
obligation to ever hire anyone! (But, you may find it worth it to hire someone
in the end.)
