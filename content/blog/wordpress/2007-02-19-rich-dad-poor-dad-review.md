[![Rich Dad Poor Dad](http://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/P/0446677450.01._SCMZZZZZZZ_V1134568041_.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0446677450%26tag=ldspdacom-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0446677450%253FSubscriptionId=0SJZR47BQGX60PK1RXG2)Before
anything else, let me give you a little background as to how I first learned
about this book and why I read it.

I have a brother in law that recommended the book a few years ago. He had two
copies, one was autographed by the other, the other, was well read, which is the
one he loaned to me. I took it home and read the introduction. I had some
interest but I couldn't help but think that Robert Kiyosaki was lying the whole
time. I did some research on the internet and found
[John T. Reed's analysis of the book](http://www.johntreed.com/Kiyosaki.html)
which in my mind confirmed my suspicions about the author. So after only reading
the first chapter I gave the book back and said I wasn't interested in reading
any further.

If you have read any of my
[previous posts](http://www.nerdydork.com/?s=dave+ramsey), you know I'm a big
Dave Ramsey fan. I was surprised to heard Dave often recommending this book to
everyone on the radio, even though he is often disagreeing with Kiyosaki on
other financial matters.

In the meantime my brother-in-law's business has started turning a profit and
another friend of mine that also recommended the book has continued to build his
business. So I thought, what the heck, I'll get the audio book from the library
and listen in my spare time.

I have to admit there were many times in the book that I still thought his
stories were a bunch of bunk and I still find John T. Reed's site more accurate.
Kiyosaki tells very detailed stories about when he was nine years old.

But on the other hand, I did appreciate a new way of looking at a few things.
His definition of an asset is an interesting one and made me reevaluate what I
would consider an asset.

All in all, I don't think I'll read anything else from Kiyosaki, nor will I ever
claim to be a Kiyosaki fan, but I am glad that I read the book. It gave me a new
perspective on certain ideas. This book alone will not make anyone rich because
I don't think it has any real usable advice, but the value comes in how you look
at life and business. It will make you think and that is always a good thing.
