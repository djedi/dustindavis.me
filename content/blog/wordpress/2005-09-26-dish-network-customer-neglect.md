I have a Satellite Comparison Guide I maintain at
[Direct-vs-Dish.com](http://direct-vs-dish.com/comments.html). I've allowed
users to post comments. A recent comment really reflects not only my feelings
concerning the company, but customer support in general.

<blockquote>Review of DISH Network by John Lo from San Jose,CA on 2005-09-20 12:45:32:

I have dish network for the past 3 years. Want to upgrade to HD but dish network
treats their existing customers like [snip]

Even if I am willing to sign up a contract for 1 yr or so, they will not offer
anything close to what they are offering for new customers. I think the CEO of
dish network just cannot think. If you can't satisfy your existing customers,
and offer them upgrades for being loyal, you have a very serious problem. Made
several calls to dish and I wasted my time and they just don't care losing you.
I even told them that I will disconnect my dish service, I was told that it's
ok. So they only care about new customers, and just don't bother about existing
customers.</blockquote>

I think the reason companies get away with this is because everyone else is
doing it. I
[recently switched](http://www.nerdydork.com/cancelled-dish-network-last-night.html)
from Dish Network to DIRECTV. There are some features I like about DIRECTV,
mainly TiVo functions, but all things considered, I think I prefered Dish
Network.

Seriously though, why do you have to play games such as cancelling and signing
up under you spouses name to get the "new customer" deal. Wouldn't it make more
business sense to keep your current customers happy rather than sending them
away to your competition? How hard would it be to say, yeah, well, give you the
new DVR and HD if you agree to another 1 year commitment. This has to make more
business sense. They keep the customer for one, plus, the installation costs
have to be much cheaper if they don't need a new dish or additional cables,
right? Why, why, why?
