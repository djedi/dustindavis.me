I was watching a segment of Napoleon Dynamite this morning and something crossed
my mind later this afternoon. Do you remember the scene where Napoleon and Pedro
are handing out those little keychains to everyone walking into school saying,
"vote for Pedro?" Well, my initial thought was that these were all the ones Deb
had made and was trying to sell earlier in the film. While this may be true,
they could also be Napoleon's since he did make like a gazillion of them at
scout camp!
