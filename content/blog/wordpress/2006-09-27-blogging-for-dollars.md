Some time last year I tried an experiment. I blogged every weekd day for one
month. My experiment was to see what kind of traffic I would get - but more
especially, what I could earn from Google Adsense from this traffic. It was
moderately successful. I certainly made more that month than any other month
before or since - maybe even more than every month combined.

Well, I've found a new easier way to
[make money](http://payperpost.com/page/blogger). I was reading my Gmail this
morning and noticed a link to [PayPerPost.com](http://www.payperpost.com). I
think this is a great idea for both bloggers and advertisers. Here is why:

1. As an advertiser you can get real blogs ranting and raving your product or
   site.

2. Blogs are great for getting better search engine placement.

3. There is more potential to earn as a blogger - especially with a blog that
   only has a small audience.

4. You can blog sporatically. You don't NEED to blog every day to generate
   income. (Of course it never hurts to blog more often.)

5. You can find topics to blog about!

So why are you still here? Go [make money](http://payperpost.com/page/blogger)!
