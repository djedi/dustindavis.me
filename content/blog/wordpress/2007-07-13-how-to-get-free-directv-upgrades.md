I was browsing my DIRECTV account online this morning and noticed that I was
eligible for various free upgrades. My first though was, "man, I could have had
another DVR all this time... for free?"

But then I read the fine print

<blockquote>Offer for existing residential customers only and requires a two-year programming commitment to any DIRECTV base package or DIRECTV Spanish-languageÂ® package, and activation of DIRECTVÂ® DVR service.</blockquote>

So I would have to renew my contract for two years, but I would also have to
activate DVR service. What if it is already activated?

In any case, after
[comparing apples to apples the pricing and channels available of various packages](http://www.direct-vs-dish.com/compare.php?displayorder=1&choice1=17&choice2=8),
I think I'll be switching to Dish Network next month anyway.
