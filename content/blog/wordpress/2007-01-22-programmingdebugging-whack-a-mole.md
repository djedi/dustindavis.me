[![Whack-a-mole](http://www.nerdydork.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/whack-a-mole.thumbnail.jpg)](http://www.nerdydork.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/whack-a-mole.jpg)It's
been crunch time lately here at work. We've been approaching a deadline for a
meeting where we are going to showcase some new software. I've heard programming
compared to whack-a-mole. You knock out one bug just to have one or two more pop
up somewhere else. And that's exactly how its been!
