lets you find the single that was number one on the day your were born. On the
day I was born it was "I Just Want To Be Your Everything" by Andy Gibb. Sadly,
I've never head of it. Luckily though, someone has posted it on YouTube so I can
re-live the tune that was most likely playing on my first car ride home :)
