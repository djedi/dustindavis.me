You've all heard the horror stories. You go to boot up you computer, nothing
happens... perhaps you hear a click... click... click...

This actually happened to me a couple years ago. Luckily my hard drive started
working again just long enough for me to get a back-up before replacing it.

I recently heard of an acquaintance that had this happen to them. It reminded me
of how vulnerable I am. I have no back-up plan!

I do however have a plan now. I'm signing up for
[mozy](http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-2267664-10430548). Yeah, I've heard about
about the great claims with Carbonite from all the radio shows (Rush, Dr. Laura,
etc. etc.). We've even used Carbonite at work. I think its great, but when I did
a search to see what other players are out there, I found mozy.

Why [mozy](http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-2267664-10430548)?

I recognized their name. There are here it Utah. A couple years ago they
sponsored a coding competition with a cash prize of `$10,000`. It was basically
a recruiting effort to expose some of the best local talent.

But it is not just name recognition alone. I've done my homework and they are
the real deal. Check out these videos:

So what are you waiting for? Get backing up! You'll thank yourself someday. It's
only `$4.95` for unlimited storage. If you can't afford it, start with the free
plan and back up your most important 2 GB (like your My Documents folder)

[Mozy Online Backup. 2GB Free or `$4.95/mo` for Unlimited Backup. It's simple, automatic and secure!](http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-2267664-10430548)

_Oh, and one tip... If you are going to sign up for unlimited and decide to pay
for a 1 year or 2 year plan, save 10% by entering "AUGUST" in the promo code
(good until the end of August obviously!)._
