[LDSPDA.com: LDS Palm & Pocket PC Software, Links, Downloads, & Forum Community Forums: View topic > Dell Axim X3i](http://ldspda.com/index.php?name=Forums&file=viewtopic&t=125)

I had a Compaq iPaq 3950 that took one too many shots to the head (my wife
dropped it in on the cement). It had a gaping hole in the top and was missing
the power button. I used a bit of guilt to persuade her to let me purchase a new
one, since my work no longer would. I picked up an Axim x3i on ebay for around
\$180 total. I love this this think. It is slimmer and lighter with the same
processor speed. The screen is only slightly smaller. But it has bluetooth and
wifi. Awesome! I've got a wireless router at home with high speed so now I can
go through my emails with my head on a pillow now! Twisted Evil

I am a little bummed out that the wifi doesn't support WPA encryption. I had to
change to my router to WEP which I hear is not secure at all.
