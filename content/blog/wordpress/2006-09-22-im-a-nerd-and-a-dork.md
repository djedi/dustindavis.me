OK, I always figured myself for a nerd, thanks in part to my family continually
reminding me of that fact. Hence, I have appropriately named my freelance
portal: [Nerdlance.com](http://www.nerdlance.com). I never knew I was a Dork
though.

Some of the questions on this quiz may not be fair. I have perfectly reasonable
explainations for all of them! ;)

      For The Record:  


A Nerd is someone who is passionate about learning/being smart/academia.

A Geek is someone who is passionate about some particular area or subject, often
an obscure or difficult one.

A Dork is someone who has difficulty with common social
expectations/interactions.

You scored better than half in Nerd and Dork, earning you the coveted title of:
**Tri-Lamb Material**.

The classic, "80's" nerd, you are what most people think of when they think
"nerd," largely due to 80's movies like Revenge of the Nerds and TV shows like
Head of the Class. You're exceptionally bright and smart, and partly because of
that have never quite fit in with your peers or social groups. Perhaps you've
realized, or will someday, that it is possible to retain all of the things that
you like about being brilliant and still make peace with the social cliques
around you. Or maybe you won't--it's really not necessary. As the brothers of
Lambda Lambda Lambda discovered, you're fine just the way you are and can take
pride in that. I mean, who wants to be like Ogre, right!?

Congratulations!
