Have you ever been out to lunch and saw the little canister full of business
cards where they draw out a card and give the customer a free lunch?

Have you ever run across and old friend and tried to exchange contact
information in a busy location - or with your kids pulling on your legs and
whining?

Well these things never happen to me either. Seriously though, these are the
occasions that I tell myself I need to get some business cards. But then I
think, why would I want to **buy** business cards for these odd occasions. I'd
certainly take free business cards.

Well my friend, you're link luck. You can get
[free business cards](http://www.business-cards-free.com) on the internet. I
found some and I only had to pay the cost to ship them. What did you expect?
Free shipping too?

Now, if I could just find more places to use them! :D
