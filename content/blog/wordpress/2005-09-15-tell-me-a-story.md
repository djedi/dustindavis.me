My wife has found an interesting cure for insomnia. I doubt this will work for
anyone else though. Whenever she is having trouble falling asleep for whatever
reason, she asks me to tell her a story about my childhood. I have pretty good
memory, so I never run out of new stories. I find them highly entertaining, but
without fail, once I finish she is OUT!
