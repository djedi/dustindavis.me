Right now, ING Direct is have a "rate sale." That's the first time I've ever
heard of the term, but in essence, what they are doing is offering a higher
interest rate from now until April 15th on any money you deposit until that
time. They normal rate is currently 3.8% which is well above my credit union's
savings account rate (which stands at about 1.2%).

I've been a member of ING Direct for over a year. I initially set it up to
automatically withdraw $10 each month. The next thing I know I have over $170
and the rates keep going up. They are FDIC insured so you can feel safe putting
your money there. It is simply a savings account (although they have ARM
mortgages and a CD account which can earn higher rates).

You link your ING Direct account to your current bank account. It takes about
2-3 business days to send and receive money between accounts. I like it because
it is just far enough away to to avoid the temptation of spending savings on
something trivial, yeat liquid enough to have when I need for real emergencies.
