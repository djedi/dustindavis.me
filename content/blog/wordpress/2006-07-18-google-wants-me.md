I got an email yesterday from someone at [Google](http://www.google.com/jobs)
that found my resume online and was wondering if I was interested in a software
engineering position to help with their QA team. Wowzers! I would so much love
to work for Google, BUT, since I recently made a career change and since I doubt
I could pull my wife outside of Utah (even to a Google campus in Colorado or
Arizona) I had to decline :( Oh well, I guess I can still claim bragging rights
eh? :D
