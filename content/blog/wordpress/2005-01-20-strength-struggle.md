Strength and struggle go together. The supreme reward of struggle is strength.
Life is a battle and the greatest joy is to overcome. The pursuit of easy things
makes men weak. Do not equip yourselves with superior power and hope to escape
the responsibility and work. It cannot be done. It is following the lines of
least resistance that makes rivers and men crooked.

- Ralph Parlette
