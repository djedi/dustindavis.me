Looking to earn some extra money? Are you wanting to develop your computer or
writing skills, but lacking ideas? Then read on to find out exactly how to do
both at the same time!

Nerdlance.com is a new feature rich web site that allows entrepreneurs and
businesses create projects that they need help with completing. This is where
you come in. There are many professionals competing to get these projects.
Often, professions demand more money for their services and struggling
businesses and entrepreneurs are willing to sacrifice a little time in order to
save some money.

You can browse projects in various categories that match your skill set and
interests. Here are five simple tips to make the most of your project bidding.

1. Start with charity work. By this I mean bid low - work cheap for a few
   projects. This will give you some experience in doing the work and allow you
   to get some customer ratings. Like eBay, Nerdlance.com uses a rating system.
   Youâ€™d be surprised at the confidence boost a project owner will get if he
   sees you have successfully completed projects in the past.

2. Be honest with your bids. Donâ€™t claim to be something you are not. If
   itâ€™s going to take you a couple months to get something done, be upfront
   and explain that. If you donâ€™t have the experience to complete a project,
   say so. Instead you can explain that you are bidding lower so that you can
   get the experience. Honesty can only reward you greater feedback and more
   projects.

3. Speak to the project owner. Read the project description thoroughly and
   describe how you can solve the problem or create the desired solution.
   Donâ€™t paste generic bids such as â€œWe are a software group base in â€¦â€
   These bids donâ€™t normally get read beyond those ellipsis.

4. Create a portfolio. As you complete projects. Create an online portfolio to
   showcase your work. You can link to this portfolio whenever you submit a bid.

5. Share projects with others. You may not have the skills or interest to
   complete a certain project, but you may know someone who does. Nerdlance.com
   has an affiliate program. Encourage your friends and acquaintances to use
   your affiliate ID to sign up and you can earn 50% commission on any fees that
   they pay for life!
