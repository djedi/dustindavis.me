[![Getting Things Done](http://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/P/0670899240.01._SCMZZZZZZZ_V1138677131_.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0670899240%26tag=ldspdacom-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0670899240%253FSubscriptionId=0SJZR47BQGX60PK1RXG2)I
finally finished reading Getting Things Done. Well, to be honest I can't say I
finished "reading" it. I read about 2/3 of the book then listened to the rest of
it on an audio book :D

I would give the book 4 out of 5 stars. It seems to be written mainly for
business people - especially the management types. Anyone can benefit from
reading it though. Since reading the book, I cleaned out my Gmail inbox
containing over 300 messages. I set up a new filing system at home (which works
MUCH better). I bought a few extra baskets and changed the way I used my "in
basket." I even bought a nice labeler!

The problem is that if you don't follow the whole system you can easily get back
in a frustrated rut. I'm still figured out how I want to do things. My biggest
problem is that I work from two computers and two locations. I have my work
office and my home office with a computer for each.

There are resolutions for this type of thing, I just need to fully implement
them. I would really recommend this book to anyone who feels they don't have
enough time to get everything done that they want or need to.
