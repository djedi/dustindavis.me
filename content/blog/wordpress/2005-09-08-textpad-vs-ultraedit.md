I have two favorite text editors. I wish I could combine their features together
though. I have used [TextPad](http://www.textpad.com) (TP) for about the last 5
years, but for a few months I've been using UltraEdit (UE) more for a couple of
handy features.

First is the FTP capabilities built in to UE. I can create several FTP accounts
and select which one I would like to save to, or open from. You edit the files
as you normally would, but when you click the save button or Ctrl+S as most
would, it uploads the file to your server!

The second feature I really love is the ability to have a sorted list of
functions when you open a PHP file. When I developed Nerdlance.com I created a
function file to hold all my commonly used functions. I found UE quite handy
when it came to jumping to the function I wanted to
modify.[ ](https://www.ultraedit.com/store/customer/home.php?partner=xhenxhe&bid=9)

I think UE falls short of TP in a few areas.

First is the regular expressions. They just don't work as I feel they should. I
think they should work more like TP and perl, but they don't. I can't remember
off what the issues I've experienced were, but I think it had something to do
with newline characters, end of string characters and the like.

Secondly is the undo feature. UE remembers every keystroke and undoes ( <- is
that a word? ) them one at a time. TP seems to have some sort of "smart" undo
features that remembers blocks of keystrokes, which is faster and therefore more
pleasing to me.

Third, is the macros. While I like how UE gives you the ability to edit macros,
what I don't like again is the undo feature. If you run a macro and it messes
up, you can't Ctrl+Z to get back where you started. There are work-arounds, yes,
but I prefer the TP way.

Fourth is the way that they both read files. TP seems to open and fix files that
have been messed up by some means or anothers such as wrong encoding or binary
FTP. Again, I can't point to examples, but I've seen it more than once, which
leads me to bring it up here.

And finally, the clip library. Again, I prefer the TP way as you can organize
you clips into categories, sort them by name, etc. UE just has one large
template library available to everything.

On all other features that I use in both tools they seem to be fairly equal.
