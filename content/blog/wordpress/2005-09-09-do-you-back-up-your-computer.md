I had a saleslady come to my home a couple weeks ago. When she asked what I do
for a living she went off on how she is so computer illiterate. Now she has a
Totally Awesome Computer so she doesn't have to worry about support costs, etc.
She justs takes it in, they fix it, and give it back. She tells them to spare
the explaination because it means nothing to her.

Before she got her TAC computer she was having difficulty with the machine she
was on. She called tech support and the young lady on the support called asked
her, "Did you back up your computer?"

She was silent in confusion for a moment and said, "Well, it's a computer, not a
car. How do I back it up?"
