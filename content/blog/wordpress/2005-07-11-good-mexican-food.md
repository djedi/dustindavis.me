My wife and I enjoy going out to eat on occasion. We don't get out as much as we
used to now that we have two kids. Last Saturday we decided to try some advice
from a friend and eat at the [ Red Iguana](http://www.rediguana.com/home.html)
in Salt Lake City. I created a
[ Google Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=736+w+north+temple,+slc,+ut+84116&spn=0.020316,0.039873&hl=en)
to help us find the place. Upon her first look my wife refused to eat there, but
after driving around downtown for a while she finally gave in.

I've since learned that it has received a number of awards for its food. I
rarely agree with critics anyway...

The food was okay... We have a habit of comparing every restaurant we eat at
with
[ Tres Hombres](http://travel.yahoo.com/p-travelguide-2745290-tres_hombres_salt_lake_city-i),
as that is our favorite restaurant in town - Mexican an otherwise. The prices
were okay, I thought we were pretty cheap until I realized that when I order a
chimichanga, that's all I get - no rice or beans. So comparitivy, I think the
prices are pretty similar.

The most unpleasant part of the new experience was the environment. There is no
air conditioning. Couple that with the spicy salsa, and it makes for a long
meal! Next time I'll take my pesos to
