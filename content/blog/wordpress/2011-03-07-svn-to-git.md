I've been using Git now for over two years. Previously, all my source control
was handled with subversion (SVN). To be honest, I can't even remember how to
use SVN. To be more honest, I cheated and used TortoiseSVN most of the time
anyway.

Every so often I want to update an old website, but my repo is in SVN. I don't
even have it installed anymore. So what do I do. I quickly convert it to Git.

Most of my important repos are stored on my [Unfuddle](http://unfuddle.com)
account. Fortunately, they support both SVN & Git. I recently converted an SVN
repo to Git. Here were the steps I took (I'm using Ubuntu).

[bash]mkdir svntemp cd svntemp git svn init
http://myusername.unfuddle.com/svn/myusername_myrepo/Â --no-metadata git svn
fetch[/bash]

... wait for fetching ... [bash]cd .. mkdir newgitrepo cd newgitrepoÂ  git init
git remote add origin git@myusername.unfuddle.com:myusername/myrepo.git cp -R
../svntemp/trunk/_ . git add _ git commit -am "initial commit" git push origin
master[/bash]

And I think we're done here. Now, back to coding!
