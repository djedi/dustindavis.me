While reading this morning, I came across the following verses:

> [2 Nephi 25:23-26](http://scriptures.lds.org/2_ne/25/23-26#23)
>
> 23 For we labor diligently to write, to persuade our children, and also our
> brethren, to believe in Christ, and to be reconciled to God; for we know that
> it is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do. 24 And, notwithstanding
> we believe in Christ, we keep the law of Moses, and look forward with
> steadfastness unto Christ, until the law shall be fulfilled. 25 For, for this
> end was the law given; wherefore the law hath become dead unto us, and we are
> made alive in Christ because of our faith; yet we keep the law because of the
> commandments. 26 And we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of
> Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that
> our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their
> sins.

This reminded me of a book I read recently by the title of
_[Believing Christ](http://deseretbook.com/store/product?sku=4499076)_. This
book explains clearly the role of Christ and our absolute need for his
atonement. It makes things so clear and more than anything gives a person hope.
While discussing this book with a woman I know, she said this was the book that
brought her back into the church. Before reading it, she didn't feel she had the
strength to come back.

If you've ever felt that you've done something so terribly wrong that you cannot
be forgiven, you don't believe Christ when He says He can heal you. You may
believe in Him. You may believe that He can forgive others, because certainly
other people have not done things as terrible as you feel you have done. Well,
this thinking is wrong. He can forgive you. He said He will forgive you. You
must believe Him when He says this.

No matter how good or righteous you may feel anther person may be, they need the
atonement just as much as you do - daily even. As verse 23 states, it is by
grace we are saved, after all we can do. Ultimately, if not for the Savior's
grace, we are lost and fallen and no amount of righteousness can restore us
until we accept the atonement of Christ and ask for forgiveness.
