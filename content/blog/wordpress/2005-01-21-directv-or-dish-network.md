I think I have got it completed. Well, mostly. I'm sure it will receive updates
on a day to day, week to week, month to month basis. I created a review site to
compare the cost & features of the two major satellite television companies
[DIRECTV](http://www.direct-vs-dish.com) and
[Dish Network](http://www.direct-vs-dish.com). I think this may help people who
are trying to decide which one they should join.
