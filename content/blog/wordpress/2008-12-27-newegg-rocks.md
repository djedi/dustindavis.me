When my friend built his own computer, I was quite impressed. I've always been
computer savvy, but building my own computer seemed over my head. What if I
bought all the parts and ended up getting a processors that was not compatible
with a motherboard for example. I was sure I could figure it out, but how much
time and money would have I have to spend trying.

I was fortunate though. I have a client that I maintained and hosted a website
for who came to me asking about computers. He just wanted a cheap one. "Should I
just go to Costco and get the one for \$500, or would I be sorry for that?" I
knew which one he was talking about. It was an eMachines. Now, I don't hate
eMachines. I owned one myself in the past. It was the first computer I was able
to afford.

So I had an idea. "Why don't you give me the \$500, and I'll build you a
computer." I explained that for that money I could possibly get better parts
that were not so integrated. That way, he if every needed to upgrade some
portion of it, it would be a lot easier. He agreed without hesitation.

My friend told me long ago that he got all his parts at
[Newegg.com](http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-2267664-10444948). So that is where I
started. They got all the categories laid out so nicely that it would be hard to
forget something. I think shopping for parts was the longest part only because
there is such a huge selection and so much information for each part. I spent a
lot of time reading reviews and learning.

The more I learned, the more I realized there was not that much to learn.

So I did it. I bought all the parts from
[Newegg](http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-2267664-10444948). They were all at my
doorstep within a few days.

I had the computer put together within an hour or two and then spent some time
installing the operating system and updating it.

It was much easier than I though and I even kept \$50 for my time. My client was
perfectly happy with his PC.

So having confidence, I saved up and built my own computer. I've been using it
for over a year without any issues (Oh wait, there was a slight issue, I
couldn't use my front audio ports. I fixed it though. I had just not installed
the audio drivers, after I did, it has been working fine).

Now, I'm saving up to build my own media center PC.

After the experiences, I can highly recommend
[Newegg](http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-2267664-10444948)! I've never purchased a
computer part anywhere else. Newegg rocks!
