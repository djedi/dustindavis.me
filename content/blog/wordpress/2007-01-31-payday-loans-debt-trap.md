![Payday Loans](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/17/21541090_e570fa794c_m.jpg)I've
never had a "payday loan." Therefore, I'm not an expert in how they work. But
being an avid [Dave Ramsey](http://www.daveramsey.com) fan, I feel they are the
biggest rip-offs on the planet.

Do you ever see wealthy people getting
[Payday Cash Advance Loans](http://www.secureloanconsolidation.com/)? Oh, but
they don't need them, they are wealthy! Well how do you think they got wealthy?
Wealth certainly didn't come by taking out more and more rip-off loans.

As Dave always says, "Do poor people things and you stay poor, do rich people
things and you get rich."

So, repeat after me... "I will never walk into a cash advance or payday loan
building!"
