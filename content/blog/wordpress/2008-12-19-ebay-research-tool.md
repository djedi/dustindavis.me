[![Research your competition](http://www.lduhtrp.net/image-2267664-10573492)](http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-2267664-10573492)My
friend introduced me to this killer tool -
[terapeak](http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-2267664-10573492).

Basically, it's like a backdoor to all of eBay's stats. So it may not be cool to
everyone.

But if you run any kind of business selling things on eBay you'll want it.

If you create websites that utilize the eBay Partner Network, you'll want it.

In my case it is the latter. I like it. I want it. I need it. I'm signing up
today.
