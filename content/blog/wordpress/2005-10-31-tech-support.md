I've seen this or something similar via email about 6 years ago. It seems to be
funnier now though :) -- Dear Tech Support:

Last year I upgraded from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0. I soon noticed that the
new program began unexpected child processing that took up a lot of space and
valuable resources. In addition, Wife 1.0 installed itself into all other
programs and now monitors all other system activity. Applications such as Poker
Night 10.3, Football 5.0, Hunting and Fishing 7.5, and Racing 3.6 no longer run,
crashing the system whenever selected.

I can't seem to keep Wife 1.0 in the background while attempting to run my
favorite applications. I'm thinking about going back to Girlfriend 7.0, but the
uninstall doesn't work on Wife 1.0. Please help!

Thanks, A Troubled User. (KEEP READING)

REPLY: Dear Troubled User:

This is a very common problem that men complain about.

Many people upgrade from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0, thinking that it is just a
Utilities and Entertainment program. Wife 1.0 is an OPERATING SYSTEM and is
designed by its Creator to run EVERYTHING!!! It is also impossible to delete
Wife 1.0 and to return to Girlfriend 7.0. It is impossible to uninstall, or
purge the program files from the system once installed.

You cannot go back to Girlfriend 7.0 because Wife 1.0 is designed to not allow
this. Look in your Wife 1.0 manual under Warnings-Alimony-Child Support. I
recommend that you keep Wife1.0 and work on improving the situation. I suggest
installing the background application "Yes Dear" to alleviate software
augmentation.

The best course of action is to enter the command C:..APOLOGIZE because
ultimately you will have to give the APOLOGIZE command before the system will
return to normal anyway.

Wife 1.0 is a great program, but it tends to be very high maintenance. Wife 1.0
comes with several support programs, such as Clean and Sweep 3.0, Cook It 1.5
and Do Bills 4.2.

However, be very careful how you use these programs. Improper use will cause the
system to launch the program Nag Nag 9.5. Once this happens, the only way to
improve the performance of Wife 1.0 is to purchase additional software. I
recommend Flowers 2.1 and Diamonds 5.0 !

WARNING!!! DO NOT, under any circumstances, install Secretary With Short Skirt
3.3. This application is not supported by Wife 1.0 and will cause irreversible
damage to the operating system.

Best of luck, Tech Support
