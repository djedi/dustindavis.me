I'm very mediocre at online marketing. I know all the theory and things I should
be doing to make money online, but I haven't hit the big time by any means. I
think a big part of the problem is that I'm not very motivated by making money.
For for some weird reason, I'm very motivated to save money!

This is where the knowledge and skills I've developed in internet marketing
begin to be entertaining and profitable. I have two example to share. One I'll
share now, the other I'll share after May (you'll understand why when I share it
then)

Example the first:

I love Rocketman! It's one of my all time favorite movies. It's just plain clean
stupid humor. I wanted a copy of it so bad on DVD. At first it was only
available as a region 2. I couldn't take a chance of it not working. LaterI
found that it was released in region 1. I saw a few copies on Amazon, but they
were selling for over
$50 per copy. I did some searching and found that the only way to order them was by joining the Disney DVD club. I didn't want to join the club for one movie. I did some calculation, and though I can't remember the exact numbers (this was two years ago) I figured if I joined the club and bought filled my requirements by buying all Rocketman movies, I could get approx 9 copies for $118.00
($13.10 each) and then quit. So, if I kept one and sold the rest to break even, I would just need to sell them for $14.75
each. Since they were selling on Amazon for \$50 I figured it wouldn't be a
problem.

My wife was quite surprised when she saw 9 copies of Rocketman show up in the
mail. Ok, by now she's probably not surprised by the weird things I do, but
rather curious. I kept one copy for my personal collection and sold the other 8
on Amazon for an average of
$40 each after shipping. So, to do the math, I got my movie and made $202.00 in
the process!

I told a friend about it and he was elated because his wife had joined the
Disney DVD club and they still had 3 movies to buy before they could fulfill
their commitment. He bought 3 copies of Rocketman and sold them promptly.

So why not wash, rinse, repeat? I told you, I'm lazy. I hated going to the post
office and shipping movies. Besides, I'm sure they have some kind of rules about
household quitting and rejoining. I did tell everyone what I did and said they
could do the same to make a quit buck, but I think they were all too skeptical
and no one took me up on it.

Don't bother now, because you can buy them new on Amazon for under \$10.

Look for the follow up to this post in a couple of months.

**UPDATE:**

I wrote the follow up post, but just before publishing it I changed my mind. As
much as I would love to share what I did (I basically got a $1000+ value from $6
worth of advertising and 1-2 hours of time). I thought it would be a once in a
lifetime opportunity, but from what I've learned, the opportunity may present
itself next year! So, I guess I'd be better off keeping this one to myself for
now.
