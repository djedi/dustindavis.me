OK, I know I recently ripped on them, but this time I have something positive to
say - sort of. I recently won a bid for
$110, which I naturally accepted. Because GAF takes a 10% fee, they immdiate deducted $11.00
from my account. As soon as I realized this, I thought, "Oh crap!", I could be a
"Gold Member" for a month for \$10 and save on all my fees.

So what I did, (and this is where GAF gets kudos) is send a help request to
refund that amount saying I mean to sign up for the gold membership first and
asked if they would refund my \$11 fee. I then signed up for gold membership. I
got my response a day later saying my account has been refunded. Cool!

Anyway, this is one thing that has been an annoyance to me about GAF, which is
why before making a fee payming on [Nerdlance.com](http://www.nerdlance.com), I
give you options to pay your fees. These options are:

1. Join the Nerd Herd for \$10.00 (then all fees are waived - basically like GAF
   gold membership)
2. Pay with PayPal (meaning you don't have to pay extra for the PayPal fees, I
   eat them)
3. Pay with your NerdBucks account (which is the fastest & easiest way - and the
   only option available on GAF)
