I got this letter from GoDaddy.com Today... Who cares? Do you think Bob is
democrat? In my opinion, if he cared so much about privacy, why not make it
free. Obviously, this is cutting in to his bottom line.

Dear Valued Go Daddy Customer,

Today I have the unfortunate responsibility of informing you that there has been
a decision made by bureaucrats of a Federal agency that takes away your right to
privacy as guaranteed by the United States Constitution.

<!-- more -->

This decision was unilaterally made by the National Telecommunications and
Information Association ("NTIA") -- http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ -- without hearings
that would determine the impact on those affected, and delivered without notice
-- in short, the NTIA decision was made without due process of any kind. This is
exactly how our government is not supposed to work.

The effect of this decision is to disallow new private domain name registrations
on .US domain names. In addition, if you already own a private .US domain name
registration, you will be forced to forfeit your privacy no later than January
26, 2006. By that time, you will need to choose between either making your
personal information available to anyone who wants to see it, or giving up your
right to that domain name.

I personally find it ironic that our right to .US privacy was stripped away,
without due process, by a federal government agency -- an agency that should be
looking out for our individual rights. For the NTIA to choose the .US extension
is the ultimate slap in your face. .US is the only domain name that is
specifically intended for Americans (and also those who have a physical presence
in our great country). So think about this for a moment. These bureaucrats
stripped away the privacy that you're entitled to as an American, on the only
domain name that says that you are an American. I am outraged by this -- you
should be also.

If, like me, you are outraged at the NTIA's decision to strip away our
constitutional right to privacy, the Web site
http://www.TheDangerOfNoPrivacy.com will provide you with a petition to sign.
(Only your name will be published, your address and email information will be
kept private.) This Web site also provides a very easy way for you to send
either a fax or an email, expressing your outrage, to your Congressperson and
Senators. This is all provided at no cost to you. All that is required is for
you to take the time to visit http://www.TheDangerOfNoPrivacy.com sign the
petition, and send the fax or email to your legislators.

On my personal Blog -- http://www.BobParsons.com -- there are a number of
articles where you can learn more about the NTIA's unfortunate decision and what
you can do to help get it reversed.

I also will be talking about our right to privacy on Radio Go Daddy, our weekly
radio show that debuts today, March 30, at 7 PM PST. To find out how to listen
in, please visit the Web site dedicated to the show, http://www.RadioGoDaddy.com

You can be sure that I, and everyone at GoDaddy.com, will do everything in our
power to get the NTIA decision reversed. However, we need your help. Please
visit http://www.TheDangerOfNoPrivacy.com to sign the petition and express your
feelings to your Congressperson and Senators.

Sincerely,

Bob Parsons President and Founder GoDaddy.com
