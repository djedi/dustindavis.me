I always thought it would be nice to sync Outlook with the Google Calendar. I
found out today that it is now possible thanks to
[OGG Sync](http://oggsync.com/).

Check it out and give it a try. There is not very much documentation, but be
sure to read what documentation they do have on installing it so you can figure
out how to use it after installing.

I should also mention that the freeware is limited to syncing the 3 days only -
so it is not a time trial, but a free version with limitations.
