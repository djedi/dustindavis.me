[Windows 7](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/) Release Candidate is
now available. I've been using the beta of Windows 7 quite happily for a couple
of months now after frustrating ordeals with Vista. The only problem I've had
with the beta version of Windows 7 is having Windows Explorer crash 3-5 times a
day. It hasn't been a huge deal because it restarts automatically after about 10
seconds. Still, it is enough to consider getting the RC.

So as I generally do before installing a new OS, I took inventory of my
installed applications and began backing up documents to an external HD I
recently bought. Files are simple enough to back up and restore, but
applications are not so easy. They all have to be reinstalled to work right,
then there is the issue of tracking down the license codes I've purchased for
the commercial software. After compiling my list of applications I use, I'm
starting to wonder if I really should install the RC, or just wait for the
official release as I will likely have to do this all over again.

So here are my apps I currently have installed in alphabetical order (bold items
I have commercial licenses for). Sorry, I'm not going to link to all of them. It
would take forever.
