So I've recently been called in my ward as the emergency preparedness
specialist. In our neighborhood we a divided up into blocks with block captains.
In the event of an emergency, each block captain will have a set of 2 way radios
for communication. I'm not a block captain, but thought it might would be a good
idea to have some 2 way radios on hand for emergency anyway. Plus, they can come
in handy for camping trips (and maybe even shopping trips, hehe)

Knowing nothing about them, other than hearing someone who uses them frequently
and owning several of them say "only get Motorola" I went off to Amazon. I
decided on the
[EM1000R model](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0014DVIL2?tag=nerdydork-20&camp=14573&creative=327641&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=B0014DVIL2&adid=1GYDJRMA67G7EWTEP0FM&).
It was the second highest seller in the category (first highest Motorola) and
the only ones with a 5 star review (granted there are only 5 reviews so far).

What I like about them is that they have a charger stand and can use
rechargeable NIMH batteries, or 3 AAA Alkaline batteries. So I can keep them
charged all the time and store some AAA batteries for emergencies. I'm ordering
today. If I don't post an update free free to drop me a line once I get them if
you want to know more as I learn more.
