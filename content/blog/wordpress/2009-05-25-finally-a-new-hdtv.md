I've wanted an HDTV for a long time. We've had the same 25" TV since we got
married 9 years ago. I've been waiting for a big deal. Well, I think I've
finally found one! Saturday I was in Wal-Mart and saw that they had a 46" Visio
1080p for
$795. That was the best deal I've seen on a 46" 1080p. I was tempted to buy it, but I generally don't make impulse buys. It tends to get me in trouble. So when I got home I checked the internet and the best deal I could find for a similar model was $900.
Well, I just happened to check again and that same model was now \$749 on
Newegg! It's a one day only Memorial day sale. It's got great reviews from what
I've seen on Newegg and Amazon. Better yet, I don't have to pay sales tax or
shipping! Thanks, yet again, Newegg!
