OK, even though I'm a big fan, I still haven't seen episode III yet. I just
though it was curious how sales have spiked for the
[trilogy](http://www.dvdanthology.com/movie508-Star+Wars+Trilogy+%28Widescreen+Edition%29.html),
[Episode I](http://www.dvdanthology.com/movie78-Star+Wars+-+Episode+I%2C+The+Phantom+Menace+%28Widescreen+Edition%29.html),
and
[Episode II](http://www.dvdanthology.com/movie239-Star+Wars+-+Episode+II%2C+Attack+of+the+Clones+%28Widescreen+Edition%29.html),
which have all hit the
[top ten in Amazon DVD sales](http://www.dvdanthology.com) this month!
