[50 First Dates](http://www.dvdanthology.com/dvd/B0001Z3TXE/50-First-Dates.html)

My wife and I watched this movie over the weekend. We heard it was quite crude
so we never really had the desire to watch it. Well, being bored with a house
full of sick kids and not being able to pawn them off to baby sitters... j/k We
borred this video from family. We both loved it. Yeah, it had its crude moments
as any Adam Sandler movie does... Yeah, Adam Sandler plays the same old down to
earth likable good guy... But the story as my wife puts it, is "really sweet."
So I guess you could say the story was all chick flick, but it was funny enough
for any guy to enjoy!
