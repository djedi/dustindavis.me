Wow, they sure are friendly over there at dvdtalk.com. I didn't even have an
account one full day. The topic was the Incredibles and it moved pixar and
Finding nemo. The moderator stepped in and said "You're off topic. No more posts
on finding nemo or pixar."

I said, "Wow, the moderators are sure ban-happy here." KERPLUNK! I'm out! Oh
well, I can guarantee we'll be more friendly at DvdAnthology.com's forum.
