I'm always on the lookout for deals. I've got nearly fifty different domain
names I've accumulated over the years. I remember how excited I was to find
[GoDaddy ](http://www.godaddy.com)back in 2001 or so offering domain names for
under \$10. I've since switched a few times. Now my current registrar of choice
is [1&1](http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-1458295-10365672). My first experience
with them was not so great. I was used to GoDaddy where updates happen fast. Due
to this and their system I really screwed up a DNS entry on a domain and it took
a week to sort out so I could use it. After abondoning them for a couple years
I've gone back and found that they've fixed the problem. To me the savings are
well worth it, especially with the number of domains I have. Plus, they offer
fee privabe registration with most registrars charge extra for. Well done 1&1!
