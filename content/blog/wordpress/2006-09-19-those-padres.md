[Last night's amazing comeback by the Dodgers](http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/gameday_recap.jsp?ymd=20060919&content_id=1670274&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=sd)
had me feeling a bit sorry for those Padres. It reminded me of a joke
[Nate Colbert](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Colbert) once told me
concerning how BAD the Padres were at the time:

<blockquote>
Last week a guy in San Diego had two Padres tickets on the dash of his car. He reported to the police that someone had broken in and left two more.
</blockquote>
