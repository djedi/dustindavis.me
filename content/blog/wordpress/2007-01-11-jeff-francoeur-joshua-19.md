![Jeff Francoeur](https://dustindavis.me/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/francoeur.thumbnail.jpg)I
really like
[Jeff Francoeur](http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/team/player.jsp?player_id=425796).
I suppose he'll take over as my favorite player after
[Chipper](http://www.chipperjones.com) retires, just as Chipper took over for
the gap left by [Murph](http://members.aol.com/brave3/murphy.htm) when he won my
respect his rookie year. Why Francoeur? I'm not totally sure. I know it has
nothing to do with my wife thinking he's the cutest guy on the team. I think it
is because he reminds of how I play baseball - very aggressive at the plate
hoping to get lucky :D

Well I've noticed that in a few of his
[photos](http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/atl/images/fan_forum/wallpapers/1024x768_atl_francour2.jpg)
he has [Joshua 1:9](http://scriptures.lds.org/en/josh/1/9) written on the back
of his batting glove.

<blockquote>Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.</blockquote>

Pretty cool, I think.
