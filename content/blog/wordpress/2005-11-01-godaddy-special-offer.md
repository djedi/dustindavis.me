I received an email from GoDaddy yesterday offering all domains for \$6.95 per
year.

<blockquote>Unlike SOME registrars, this offer is NOT restricted to NEW customers. We know who got us here Â— it's loyal Go DaddyÂ® customers like you who helped make us the #1 registrar worldwide. **You deserve the best deals we've got to offer!**</blockquote>

Well, sorry, but I'm not buyin' it! I keep all my domains with
[Hostway.com](http://www.hostway.com). They are always \$6.95 and there is no
ICANN fee to pay.

There is cheaper... [1&1](http://www.1and1.com) offers \$5.99 domains, but I had
issues the first time I tried using them, so I stuck with hostway.
