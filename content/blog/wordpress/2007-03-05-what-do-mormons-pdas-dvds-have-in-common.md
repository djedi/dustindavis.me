I was looking at some web statistics this morning and I noticed that I had quite
a few hits on my [DVD site](http://www.dvdanthology.com) coming from a forum at
[LDS Mingle](http://connect.ldsmingle.com/boards/view.html?b=4&t=1227034). I was
intrigued (mostly because I'm [LDS](http://www.lds.org)) so I signed up
temporarily to see what the talk was about. A member there suggested visiting
[DVD Anthology](http://www.dvdanthology.com) to track your DVD collection, keep
track of movies you loan out and print lists of your movies - exactly what I
created the site for :)

Another man piped up and suggested, why bother when you can keep track of all
your movies on your PDA and not have to be tied down to the internet. They
argued for a bit about the pros & cons of each. I thought it was funny, because
little do they know that the creator of
[DVD Anthology](http://www.dvdanthology.com) is also the owner of
[Shilbon Software](http://www.shiblon.com) and [LDS PDA](http://www.ldspda.com)!
:D

I wanted to join the conversation, but it required that I pay for membership.
Since I'm already married I couldn't see the value in it. ;)
