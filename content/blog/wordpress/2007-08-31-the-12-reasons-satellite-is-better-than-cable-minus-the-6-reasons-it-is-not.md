The top 12 reasons satellite television (i.e.
[DIRECTV & Dish Network](http://www.direct-vs-dish.com)) kick cable's (i.e.
Comcast) Butt:

1. More channels â€“ Satellite providers are available across the country and
   out of the country even. More customers means more customer demands and hence
   more channels and packages available. Let's say a particular channel is
   popular and available back east and you want to watch it on the west coast.
   You are much more likely to have this channel included in you satellite
   package that you would in your cable package. For example, I like watching
   Braves games and I live in Utah. Many of the games are played on SportsSouth.
   That channel is available on both DIRECTV & Dish Network, but not available
   through my local cable provider.

2. Cheaper â€“ Thanks to the two major players in the market, the costs are
   quite reasonable. You will find by comparing packages that you can get much
   more for your money than you can with cable.

3. No Activation Fees â€“ Order from either satellite provider and they will be
   out within a couple days and get you all set up, for free! Cable always tends
   to tack on a $30-$100 setup fee.

4. Better Equipment â€“ Enjoy top of the line gadgets from the satellite dealers
   â€“ again, in most cases it is free.

5. Free DVR! â€“ Even with the cheapest satellite plans, you can get multiple
   DVR's for free. Once you've had a DVR it's hard to imaging not owning one.
   Cable's DVR's seem a bit out of reach in my mind for the average consumer.

6. All Digital â€“ All channels are digital on the satellite. This is not the
   case with "digital cable".

7. More sports â€“ Looking back at reason number 1, you will see why this is the
   case. Plus, DIRECTV has more sports than any other provider. If you are a
   true sports fan, DIRECTV is your only options really.

8. And Music â€“ DIRECTV has XM satellite and Dish Network has Sirius. What does
   Cable have?

9. Customer Satisfaction â€“ OK, everyone will have their complaints and when
   there are problems with TV service I've found that people bark loud! But
   overall, based on consumer surveys, Dish Network is #1, and DIRECTV is #2.
   Oddly, is seams customers are more happy when they pay less and get moreâ€¦
   go figure.

10. More HDTV â€“ Satellite has led the way when it comes to HD. Soon DIRECTV
    will air 150 channels in HD including local channels.

11. Availability â€“ This obviously will not apply to MOST people, but if you
    live in Rural area that doesn't have a cable company, or a new development
    where the utilities have not yet come to you, you basically have no other
    choice.

12. Portability â€“ My mom is weird but, I know whenever they take their camper
    out, they take along their extra satellite dish and receiver and have
    satellite TV with them while their camping (if you can call it camping).
    Have you ever heard of anyone taking their cable with them?

â€¦ And the 7 reasons why cable has its strong points:

1. Optional Set top box - It comes with a reciever, which is needed if you want
   to have the programming guide and On Demand, but it is not really necessary.
   You can plug the cable right into your old TV, just like the good old days.
   This also makes it handy if you have a [Media Center PC](http://byomc.com),
   you don't have to worry about using an IR blaster.

2. Reliability â€“ I went 5 years without having a problem with my satellite
   including wind, rain & snow, then one day it went fuzzy. That's when I
   switched to the other provider and problem was solved. There may be occasions
   when snow or some other environmental variable may cause interference with
   your satellite. You just don't have this problem with cable. That's not to
   say cable is perfect. It seems my cable high speed internet has more outages
   than my satellite, but that's a different beast.

3. Local packages â€“ Cable companies are generally local and they know what
   locals want. The biggest example I can think of is right here in Utah. BYU
   and University of Utah Football is HUGE in the fall. The mountain west games
   are now being played on 3 different channels: 1. The Mountain (MTN); 2.
   Versus; 3. CSTV. Comcast has all three channels in their basic package.
   Neither DIRECTV nor Dish Network carry the Mountain. It is a new station and
   they claim they don't have enough demand yet. I personally thing the real
   issue is because Comcast owns the Mountain. Damn them all!

4. Package Deals â€“ Sticking with the local them, you can often get your phone
   and internet through your cable company, which can save you some money.

5. On Demand â€“ Comcast loves to tote their On Demand stuff. This basically
   lets you choose from a library of shows and movies that you can watch anytime
   â€“ much like YouTube ;)

6. No Roof DÃ©cor â€“ Hey, you can always put the satellite on the side of your
   house if you don't like it on the roof ;)

7. No Contract â€“ Often, if you're going to take advantage of the free
   equipment and installation with the satellite providers it will require a one
   or two year contract. With cable there is generally no contract so you can
   cancel at any time.
