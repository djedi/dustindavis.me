My wife called me hysterical last week. Our two year old daughter had written
all over every cushion of our brand new sofa. This sofa is a red microfiber
sectional. It was this year's tax return 101 costing around \$2300. I asked he
to calm down for her sake and I went straight to Google. Surely we can't be the
only ones with a terrible two year old writing on a brand new micro-fiber sofa
with a blue ball point pen! :) I was write (sorry for the typo...)

I found the following:

Hi Andy. How do I remove ball point ink from our "BRAND NEW" (!!) micro fiber
sofa! Ahhh two year olds and ink pens...why why why!? Thanks so much if you have
an answer ;-) Dear Laura: visit www.carbona.com. They have the answer and the
chemical to remove ball pen ink. A two year old shouldn't have access to a ball
pen. It can be dangerous. Just wait,"terrible twos" become "terrific three's"
before you know it. Good Luck, with both the stain and the child[rearing], Andy

Well, I found the carbona near the laundry detergent section in Albertsons. It
worked all right. It took a while rubbing out all the ink, but it's out and we
are greatly relieved. My wife has since thrown away all the pens, crayons, etc
in the garbage.

Thank you Andy, whoever you are! And, thank you Carbona.
