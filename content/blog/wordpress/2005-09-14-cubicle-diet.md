I work 8:00 - 5:00 in a cubicle. If you're a programmer you may be like me. It
is hard to get up sometimes when you're in the middle of programming. In the
past I would go all day without getting up to eat or drink. I was totally
screwing up my metabolism according to
[Tom Venuto](http://zushop.com/salesletter/burnthefat). I've since tried to be
more conscious of eating 6 meals a day and drinking more water. Over the last 2
months I've lost about 15 lbs of fat. I've also been exercising, but I think my
diet has gotten my metabolism back into shape.

The hardest part is packing my meals each morning. I often forget, or simply
don't make the time in the morning. On these days is where my Oatmeal comes in
handy. I have a big box of spoons, a box of Splenda packets, and some unflavored
packets of instant oatmeal (Wal-Mart brand). I put two packets or oatmeal in a
foam cup and add a packet of two of splenda. My company has hot water & coffee
supplies on hand. Sometimes I like to add a coffee creamer. If I'm feeling like
a treat, I'll throw in some hot chocolate mix. The taste kind of reminds me of
the no-bake cookies I used to make as a kid.
