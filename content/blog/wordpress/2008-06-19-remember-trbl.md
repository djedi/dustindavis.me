This post (like many I write) is mainly for myself.

When using CSS padding or margin, I generally will write margin-top,
margin-bottom, margin-left, etc. I know there is easier syntax where I can
specify all for with one line such as

margin: 0 10px 88px 10px;

The problem is, I can never remember which one is where. Know I'm not going to
forget. It's simply top, right, bottom, left... TRBL, TRouBLe, trouble. Who can
forget trouble?

Sometime I want the top and bottom the same and the left and right the same. It
is also a one liner:

margin: 10px 20px; /_ top-bottom, right-left _/

No, I'm not going to remember TBRL, that would be stupid. I'll just remember to
start at Top. See, no TRouBLe at all!
