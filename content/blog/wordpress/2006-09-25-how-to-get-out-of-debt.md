I'm a big fan of
[Dave Ramsey](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0785263268%26tag=ldspdacom-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0785263268%253FSubscriptionId=0SJZR47BQGX60PK1RXG2).
I'm sure he'd endorse this book! ;)

I was taking notes:

"Don't buy stuff you cannot afford"

"If you don't have any money, you should not buy anything."

"Sounds confusing!"

"And where would you get this 'saved money?'"

"You make sure you have money, then you buy it."

"It's in the book. It's only 1 page long."

"The advice is priceless and the book is free."

"Yeah, we can put it on our credit card."

"Seriously, If You Don't Have the Money, Don't Buy It." [tags]debt, funny,
