When I think of history and all the things invented over time, I think the
greatest invention would have to be the thermous jug no, wait... the straight
line. It just baffles me how this ever go invented. Take the ruler for example.
Look how perfectly straight it is. How would you reproduced something like that
before anything else was invented? I don't know if anything in nature that is
that perfectly straight! Baffling...
