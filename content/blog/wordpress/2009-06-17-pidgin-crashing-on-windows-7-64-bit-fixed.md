Ever since installing Windows 7 RC, I have not been able to run
[Pidgin](http://www.pidgin.im). It would put an icon in the tray, then
disappear. Finally after searching the net high and low and found
[this comment](http://finicity.uservoice.com/pages/general/suggestions/11731) on
an open pidgin ticket that seemed to resolve the problem.

I also had the same issue with XAMPP installed. Thanks Chowarmaan, whoever you
are!
