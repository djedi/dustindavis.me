I am all about getting a good deal, but sometimes you just need to pay a little
extra. A few years ago I started registering my domains through www.hostway.com
rather than www.godaddy.com to save a few bucks. With over 50 domain names the
savings can really ad up. I did try www.1and1.com to save another dollar, but
had a terrible experience with them. Apparently, after registering my domain
name, I logged in too soon to change my nameservers. It screwed their whole
system up and they blamed it all on me!

Well, recently I decided to give them another chance thinking they must have
improved their site by now. Well, I made the mistake of registering a domain
there that I later wanted to use as the main domain for vps (virtual private
server) account I had set up. There is no option (that I could find to set up my
own name servers (or domain host) for my domain names. So I tried to transfer my
domain name to Godaddy where they make it extremely easy to do so. (It is
somewhat simple to set them on Hostway, but you have to jump through hoops if
you ever want to edit them.) But I got a message that I have to wait 60 days
before transferring a domain :( So then I tried to contact 1&1 support to see if
I was just missing something and if it was possible to do somewhere on their
site. After about 3 days I finally got a response with a detailed step by step
process on how to edit my DNS settings. Apparently they had no idea what I was
talking about. Oh well, by the time I got their response I had already found
another domain to use. This time I registered it at GoDaddy.com. It seriously
took me 5 minutes to register, set my domain host and have it propogate! Wow,
very impressive GoDaddy!
