While trying to install iOS5 today I kept getting an error message something to
the effect of:

<blockquote>The iPhone "Dustin's iPhone" could not be restored.
An unknown error occurred.</blockquote>

After 4 attempts I could see I was getting nowhere. So I clicked the Restore
button. After doing a factory restore, iOS5 was installed. Everything seems to
be working now.

Hope this helps!
