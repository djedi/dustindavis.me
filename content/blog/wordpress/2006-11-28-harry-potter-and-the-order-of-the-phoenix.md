I've really enjoyed the harry potter series. After watching the first movie I
read the book. I then read each of the following books before the new movie came
out. I was disappointed with how much they left out of the last one. I
understand why they have to cut so much out, but it can be hard to sit and enjoy
a movie when things are not as you remember them.

So this time I'm waiting until after I watch the movie to read the book. I found
this sneak peak on Google video.
