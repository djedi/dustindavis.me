You can now go rant and rave about your favorite team and have a chance to win
some tickets to their next game at
[GoTeamsGo Sports Forum](http://www.goteamsgo.com/).

Here are the details of the contest:

<blockquote>$300 Ticket Contest
Pick the Score and Win Tickets
We're having a pick-the-score & pick-the-winner contest. Chat with sports fans and place your picks on football and baseball games. Also pick the Nextel Cup race winners.

$300 in Free Tickets
We're giving away $300 in tickets. We've partnered with
e-Tickets.us.com and TicketsNow.com for the prizes.

How to Play

1. Goto our forum for any of the NFL teams, any listed NCAA football teams, any
   MLB team, or the NASCAR forum.
2. Find the thread for the next upcoming game or Nextel Cup race. If it's a game
   where both teams have a forum, the game prediction thread will be in the home
   team's forum.
3. Post your prediction. Tell us who will win plus the exact score. For NASCAR,
   pick the top 2 finishers in order.
4. If your prediction is correct, come back after the game and let us know about
   your correct pick in the Correct Picks Thread thread.

Tiebreaker 5) If we have more than 1 person get a correct pick, we'll pull 2
correct picker's names at random. Name with more posts for Oct 18-23 will get
1st prize, other name will get 2nd prize. So you're more likely to win 1st place
if you chat alot with the other sports fans here at GoTeamsGo.

Contest Dates The contest begins October 3 and ends at midnight on October
23, 2006. We'll count posts made from Oct 18-23 in deciding 1st prize and 2nd
prize between the 2 winners.</blockquote>
