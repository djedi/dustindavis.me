If you use Google Adsense, you may have noticed the new referrals tab at the top
of the page. Now Google will pay you
$100 for anyone who signs up for Adsense and earns $100. Google will also pay up
to \$1 for anyone you refer that downloads and uses Mozilla Firefox for the
first time.

What a deal! Not only do users get a better browser, but you get a dollar ;)
