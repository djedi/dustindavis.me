All about Comcast, Qwest, and Vonage. See how I feel about each of their
services:<!-- more -->

## Comcast

Let me tell you all about my digital home. We have had Comcast high-speed
internet for about 3-4 years now. It was formally AT&T.; I think they are pretty
pricey at
$52.99 per month, but if I could find any other provider with the speeds they offer for a cheaper price, I will happily switch. 
(From now until April 30, 2005, when you sign up you can get 6 months for 
$19.99,
\$25 cash back, and a free MP3 Player. Click Here to get this deal.)

## Qwest

[Qwest](http://www.qwest.com/) DSL is available where I live, but it is much
slower and in order to get a better price than what I am paying for Comcast they
would require some type of phone plan. It used to be that I didn't really have
an option for that either. But about two or three years ago I called Qwest to
see about getting a better long-distance rate. I had seen them advertising 10
cents a minute in state long distance or something. I think I was using another
company for long distance and paying about 15 cents per minute or so. It was
really adding up with the phone call my wife was making to her mother. I can't
remember all the excuses they gave me but would not give me a good deal on long
distance. A friend told me about a new VOIP (Voice Over IP) company that his dad
had signed up with called Vonage. I'm sure by now you may have heard of them,
but at the time they were fairly new. I signed up for a 24.99 a month plan which
gave me unlimited local calling, free in state long distance, and 500 minutes of
out-of-state long distance (which I never came close to using).

## Vonage

Initially, Vonage was a pain in the butt to say the least. The modem was
constantly loosing its connection and the phone would be out for up to a day or
so. This was quite a frustration at the time as this was our only phone service.
So, if it ever went out, we were basically without a phone. I had a few other
gripes to. In order to call anyone - even your next door neighbor, you had to
dial the full area code as if you were calling long distance. This took a while
to get used to. Also, if I ever wanted to check my voicemail from somewhere
other than home, I would have to call a certain number, which could be long
distance depending on where I was at the time.

Well, a lot of improvements have been made since then. The system is not very
stable. It is more likely that Comcast will go out rather than Vonage. When it
does, which is rarely, it is quickly restored within an hour or two. It is not
so much of a problem since my wife and I have
[cell phones with great rates](http://www.dpbolvw.net/dt121shqnhp469AD7EA4B79D59B).
Their plan has now changed too. For the same price, I now have unlimited long
distance to the US and Canada and if I ever need to call to South Africa for fun
they also have the best international rates I've seen. The greatest part about
the plan changes is I didn't have to do a thing. They automatically kept giving
me better rates. It's not like
[Dish Network](http://www.direct-vs-dish.com/dish-network/) & other companies
where you have to call and threaten to leave before they transfer you to an
"account specialist" to negotiate a good deal to keep you happy. They just sent
me an email and said in effect - "Guess what, you can now talk all you want in
the US & Canada..."

They have also listened to customer complaints about having to dial the full
area code. Now I can call anyone in my area code - even numbers that would
normally be long distance, without the area code. Just a little thing, but I
think it is great.

Also, I can now easily check my voicemail by calling my home number and pressing
pound when the message starts. It would just as you would expect it to.

Some other really cool things I love about Vonage include:

1. I got to keep my original number. I even moved to a new area where I may be
   expected by Qwest to order a new number. I simply took my equipment with me.
   Once I had Comcast set up in my new home, I plugged in my Vonage modem and
   things worked out perfectly. I didn't have to give out a new number to
   anyone. I didn't have to call Vonage. I later simply logged on the internet
   and updated my billing address.

2. Voicemail, Caller ID, Call Waiting and all the other features you would pay a
   premium for with Qwest come standard.

3. My reception and sound quality was actually way better than Qwest. Something
   Qwest had told me was just a problem with my house's internal wiring and
   nothing they could do about it. This actually made me a little upset since we
   had a brand new home and I did all the wiring myself. Vonage seemed to like
   my internal wiring.

4. Speaking of internal wiring, initially I had just one phone plugged straight
   into the modem. This was also a bummer. But I learned that I could easily get
   my whole house wired by plugging the line out of the modem into a wall jack,
   which then gives the rest of the outlets in the home a working phone line. If
   you need a phone by your modem still, just get a simple splitter than can be
   picked up at any [Wal-mart ](http://www.walmart.com)or even grocery stores.
   If you do this, make sure you unplug the Qwest (or your local phone
   company's) phone line coming in to your house.

5. As soon as you get Vonage you're going to want to tell everyone about it.
   When you to, you can get a free month, as well as the person signing up. It
   is great incentive to spread the word and give your friends a free month
   trial so they can afford to keep their current line to try it out.

6. One think I have enjoyed from the beginning is getting emails when I have a
   new voicemail. You can set you account up to send you an email notifying you
   of new message and optionally include the message. In order to save space and
   bandwidth on my email account, I just have it notify me. I can see the number
   of the person that left the message. Then if I want I can go online and
   listen to the message.

7. Speaking of going online. I can check my account online at any time to see a
   list of number and names of people that have recently called and calls I have
   placed.

But anyway, that's my rants & raves on Vonage. If you don't know of anyone that
currently has Vonage and you want to get a free month, you can use my referral
by clicking here. You will need high-speed internet, such as cable or DSL. You
can click here to get Comcast for only \$19.99 for six months. Don't worry,
there are not contracts for either Vonage or Comcast so you are not require to
stay or member or pay a fee to cancel.

## Qwest Epilogue

You know, I really feel bad about talking so rudely about
[Qwest](http://www.qwest.com/) since one of my best friends is a Qwest salesman,
but I simply cannot resist! After we had had Vonage for about six months or so,
a Qwest salesperson called my wife and offered us 7 cents per minute long
distance if we were to switch back! My wife explained that I had left because
they wouldn't give us a 10 cent long distance plan, but now we have free long
distance. The sales person actually agued with my wife that there was not
company in existence offering free long distance. Oh well! I'm sure that
salesperson knows better by now.
