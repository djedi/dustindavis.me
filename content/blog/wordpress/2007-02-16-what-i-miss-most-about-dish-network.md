![Dish Network](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/69/223016871_3683d5ca27_m.jpg)Iâ€™ve
been a DIRECTV customer for a year and a half now. Overall I am happy, but
everyone once in a while I remember what I miss about my old Dish Network
account.

First of all there was the DVR. I think with time all DVR systems continue to
improve, but what I miss most about my Dish DVR is the ability to skip ahead 30
seconds. This allowed me to press the skip button approximately 4 times and jump
through all the commercials. With my current DVR, I have not other option but to
fast forward through them. Even at the fastest speed it is not as fast as
pressing the â€œjump aheadâ€ button 4 times. Also, at the fastest speed I have
to pay close attention to the scenes or I can easily go past the point I wanted
to start watching again.

The second thing I miss most is the display guide. Obviously DIRECTV has a
display guide, but I prefer Dish Networks. I still own the 25â€ TV we purchased
at Costco with money we were given at our wedding nearly 7 years ago. Dish
Network has a big, easy to read guide. DIRECTV is much more fancy â€“ especially
on our TiVo system. Because of this it is much slower and harder to read on our
archaic TV.

My third issue always deals with the display guide. On Dish Network, we could
easily see from the guide which channels we did not subscribe to. They appeared
in red. I donâ€™t know why DIRECTV doesnâ€™t have this feature. You can select
the option to only see the channels you subscribe to, but from my experience
this doesnâ€™t work very well and you still see way too many channels you
donâ€™t want to see. If you donâ€™t have the channel, you donâ€™t really have a
way of knowing just from the guide display.

And while Iâ€™m still on the topic of the guide, let me bring up another
complaint. With our Dish Network system, my wife and I could have our own custom
lists of the channels we like to watch most. It was easy to set up and easy to
see what list you were on, and very easy to switch between those lists. It seems
DIRECTV only has one custom list which we use to filter out all the pay per view
and other channels we donâ€™t get or never watch (like all those shopping
channels). Plus, changing between viewing all, viewing subscribed, or viewing
your custom list is a major ordeal of going into the setup menu and drilling
down to the right option. With Dish Networkâ€™s system, you just press the guide
button again to switch between these lists.

So with everything in life, we canâ€™t have it all. But these four points along
with the fact the Dish Network can be owned at a cheaper price make it an
appealing choice for much of the TV watching population.
