I know i have changed my theme a number of times in the past, but this is
probably the first time I felt a reason to. I was thinking my site looked too
[red](http://rubyonrails.org/). I wanted something more
[green](http://djangoproject.com) ([pink](http://www.djangopony.com/) crossed my
mind, but only briefly!). That's what I love about Wordpress and the Wordpress
community. It's so easy to change the look and feel of your blog in just 2
minutes and keep all your content intact.
