![](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/9/14296081_601d68aed0_m.jpg)I'm currently
trying to learn Ruby on Rails. I guess now is somewhat of an odd time to be
learning as I seem stuck in archaic examples and tutorials written for 1.2.6 and
2.0 has been released and changed the way many things are done.

Take scaffolding for example. When I first starting learning about ROR and
CakePHP, I thought it was pretty cool that I could put in a one-liner to
generate a view representing a database table, then I could run a command to
generate the code for that scaffolding if I wanted to use it as a base.

Well, it seems they took all that out of ROR in 2.0. Now there is one way to do
it, from the command line, the first time. No more one liners and no more
building the scaffolding based on the database table :(

Fortunately someone for ROR talk pointed me to two resources that I have found
helpful:
