Yesterday I attended the advanced workshop at ng-conf. I thought I\'d share some
of the highlights.

There were four rooms for the advanced workshops. We stayed in the same room
while the instructors rotated.

## AngularJS Animation

Our first session was on
[AngularJS Animation]("https://github.com/simpulton/angularjs-animation-workshop")
by Lukas Ruebbelke. I\'ll be honest, I\'ve been spoiled by being able to work
with great designers the past 5 years or so, so I haven\'t kept up on design &
CSS. So that said, I\'ve relied on them to do all the amazing UX animations &
such.

So this was all new to me and it was great to see the magic behind CSS
transitions and how to make them work with angular. We did have some issues with
wifi so it took a little longer to get started that we had hoped.

Lukas had some great demos setup up for us to play around with. I had the most
fun with [this example]("http://plnkr.co/edit/6FIDVVSw4NmkVd0T8x19") adding a
jack-in-the-box transition effect to the images.

## Advanced Directives

Our second session was on
[advanced directives]("https://github.com/joemaddalone/advanced-directives") by
Joe Maddalone. This was my favorite session due to the topic, the content, and
the hands on examples.

I know I don\'t use directives enough in AngularJS. It was great to see some of
the advanced features in directives.

It was interesting to see how to build a directive to loop through data as an
alternative to ng-repeat. I especially enjoyed learning about
`transclude: \'element\'`. I admit it was a little hard to grasp, so I may have
to go over it again and play around with it more.

## Lunch

Lunch was provided and catered by the Little America Hotel. It was amazing as
their food always is. I just wanted to give a shout out, that\'s all.

## Angular Formly

Our third session was on
[Angular Formly]("http://formly-js.github.io/angular-formly/") by Kent C. Dodds.

I have to admit, I really hate writing forms. In fact, over 10 years ago I wrote
sort of mini language to create forms. I would parse it with Perl to generate
html for forms.

One feature I really love in [Django]("https://www.djangoproject.com/") is their
[forms implementation]("https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/topics/forms/").

I haven\'t really had to work with forms for several months, so I haven\'t felt
that pain, but I would say that if I were to create any type of form with more
than 3 or 4 fields, or if I had an app with multiple forms, I would most likely
use Formly.

Firmly basically lets you code out your forms in JavaScript. I limits the amount
of coding you have to do and gives you consistent looking forms with many great
features to do everything you need to get done.

## Protractor

Our last session was on [Protractor]("http://angular.github.io/protractor/#/")
by Ben Clickinbeard.

Protractor is basically an end to end testing framework for Angular apps.

I apologize to Ben, but I kind of checked out of this session and went back to
learning about animation and css transitions.

It had nothing to do with the presenter, but rather the topic. I spend 7 years
in QA and I find testing a boring subject overall. I know some companies are all
about test driven development, but I\'m not a fan so this whole topic just had
me disinterested.

## Summary

Overall it was a great day to step out of the home office and spend the day
learning new things - and I did learn a lot of new things. Good job Egghead.io
team for the presentations.
