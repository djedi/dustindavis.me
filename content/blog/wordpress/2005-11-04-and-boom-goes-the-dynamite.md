Wow, I can't believe I just heard "" for the first time today. There are
[15,800](http://www.google.com/search?q=boom+goes+the+dynamite) results for that
search phrase on Google.

Pick one of them - any one of them, and watch the video. It's painful, but
funny.

Teasers:

- "Regie Miller's lookin' good - he shoots the 3, and it good!"

(You know, it wasn't even a 3 pointer...)

- "Later he gets the rebound... passes it to the man... shoots it... and boom
  goes the dynamite."

("he" was tall white boy - wasn't Reggie Miller. :) Maybe it was Andrew Bo-Got
:) )

- "OK great! Thanks a lot for that look into sports Brian." "Yeah!"

(Thank you indeed Brian Collins!)
