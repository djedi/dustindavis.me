Today while doing some programming on [ZuSHOP](http://www.zushop.com), I
[found a product](http://zushop.com/products/708/blog-submitter-pro-7.0) that
upon first glance I thought was creating all these blog spam problems. Well,
maybe it is, maybe it's not. I can't quite tell.

For \$147.00 you can get a product called
[Blog Submitter Pro 7.0](http://zushop.com/salesletter/satcom) that will
apparently go around posting comments to blogs, then sending pings to spiders
that these blogs have been updated. Sounds like spam to me!

Has anyone used this software before? Can you tell me if it is simply another
somewhat intelligent blog spammer?
