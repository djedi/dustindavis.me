I thought it was odd that Brian McCann got thrown out in last nights game. It
seems to me the ump was just on a major power trip there!

<blockquote>
After Davies issued a third-inning leadoff walk to Carlos Delgado, Brian McCann had a civil exchange with West, who promptly issued the soft-spoken catcher his first career ejection.

"I asked him, 'Where did you have that call?'" McCann said. "He said, 'I had it
low.' Then he asked me, 'Where did you have it?' I said, 'I had it down the
middle.' Before I could even ... I was getting thrown out. There wasn't one cuss
word. I wasn't even yelling at him."
