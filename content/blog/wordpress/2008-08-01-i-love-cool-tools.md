I love cool tools! I wanted to start a
[new blog](http://dailytendermercies.com). So I registered domain, set up an
account on my [cPanel](http://www.cpanel.net/index.html)
[VPS](http://www.liquidweb.com/?RID=redseam), used
[Fantastico](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastico_%28web_hosting%29) to
create a [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) blog, found a theme and modified some
settings. Viola! - a new blog in less than an hour. Now I just have to wait for
[1&1](http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-2267664-10564939) to update the DNS servers.
I think if I registered the domain at
[Godaddy](http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-2267664-10388358) I really could have the
site live and ready to go in under an hour. (I use
[1&1](http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-2267664-10564939) simply because they are
cheaper.)

Oh, and by the way. I made this post using
[ScribeFire](http://www.scribefire.com/), which is also one cool tool!
