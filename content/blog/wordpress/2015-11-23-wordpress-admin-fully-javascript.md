I just saw WordPress admin is
[now running on node/react/flux](http://ma.tt/2015/11/dance-to-calypso/). That
is pretty huge. I've downloaded their mac desktop app and I'm writing my first
post using it.

While I don't do much PHP development these days, a lot of my day has moved from
Python to JavaScript. I've always felt that is the way things are going. So this
is huge to see WordPress moving this direction.Â I don't know what their plans
are for WordPress sites, but if they move the whole platform to JavaScript it
will really be a death nail to PHP.
