I recently built my own computer and I know from experience it can be a pain in
the butt finding and fixing issues. (In my case it was the bios not giving my
RAM enough voltage.)

I am the family tech support guy. It makes sense that every family has one of
these, otherwise, you may be left to the wolves trying to find an honest
computer repair storeâ€¦
