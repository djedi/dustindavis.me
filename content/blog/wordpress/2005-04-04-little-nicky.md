[DVD Anthology : Little Nicky](http://dvdanthology.com/movie1894-Little
Nicky.html)

I rented this from the library and watched it over the weekend. What a crazy
freaked out show! It's always a hard decision whether or not to watch Adam
Sandler. He's funny, but can be way too crude at (many) times. It might be funny
to watch with a bunch of stupid friends in high school, but not with your wife.
:oops:
