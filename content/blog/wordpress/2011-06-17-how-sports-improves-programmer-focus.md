[![](https://nerdydork.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/clear-the-mechanism-150x150.png)](https://nerdydork.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/clear-the-mechanism.png)There
was some talk recently about distractions at work. Guys were complaining they
can't get anything done with so many distractions. We used to have an open work
space where you could see and hear everyone in the room. Now we have higher
cubicle walls. Personally, I preferred the old layout.

When a someone tells me they can't focus because there is a conversation going
on in another cubicle, I want to just tell them to "clear the mechanism". Sadly,
I don't think any of them know what I would be referring to. It seems all the
programmers I currently work with now hate sports & and make it known.

What I am referring to is the scene
in [For Love of the Game](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0126916/) where Billy
Chapel is starting to pitch. Yankees fans are being loud and obnoxious (go
figure). Just before throwing the first pitch he says to himself, "Clear the
mechanism". The crowd blurs and falls silent and Chapel enters his zone.

I was going to share this video with co-workers, but I couldn't find it, so I
took the time to snip it off my DVD.

This is for real. I played football, basketball, and baseball in high school.
Honestly, I don't remember the crowd when playing. There are times when you do,
like when timeout is called, or your passing a ball in-bounds and guys are
yanking on your jersey. But most of the game, you are so focused on the game
that you don't even know there is a crowd around you.

You really can get in a zone while programming. I don't notice other
conversations around me unless I choose too. I can get in a zone while
programming that I don't notice much of anything around me.

Sadly, I don't have tips on how to develop this type of focus — just letting you
know its for real.
