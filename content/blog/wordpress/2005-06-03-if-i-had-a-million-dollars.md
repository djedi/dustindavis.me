I was thinking, what if I had one million dollars given to me (tax free). What
would I do with it? Well, my first thought was to pay off my house and cars, but
then I realized one million dollars is a lot, do I really like where I'm living,
I could buy a nicer house somewhere else.

So let's assume you were given one million dollars _to spend_ and you only had
one month to do so. Also, you may not move or buy any houses. Now what?

Well, I would start by paying off my house, cars, and any other debts :). Then I
would fix up my house with some major projects such as: 1) tear down our old
garage and add a new one built on to the house. 2) HIRE someone to finish the
sprinklers and landscaping. 3) While I'm at, since I've torn down the old
garage, I would build an automatic batting cage in the back yard since I have
the extra room. 4) fix the plumbing in our home 5) Add central air and a new
furnace 6) Big flat panel TV in the basement 7) Put new tile in the kitchen 8)
Heck, we're putting on a new garage, let's just make the kitchen a little bigger
so we can fit our big table in the dining room. 9) Put a nice new door on our
house. 10) Hire someone to paint our house 11) pour new cement in our driveway
and sidewalks. 12) Install a nice new mailbox...

Geez, I'm starting to notice a pattern here. I might as well just buy a new
home! :)
