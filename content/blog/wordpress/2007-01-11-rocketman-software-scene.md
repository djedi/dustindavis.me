My mother-in-law called me last night to see if it was possible to extract clips
off of DVDs and then make a compilation of these clips on a new DVD. I had to
assume it was, but honestly I've never tried. So I spent my morning trying. I
found it was possible and even free with the tools I had available.

I also found a
[nice free VOB to AVI converter](http://alltoavi.sourceforge.net/). Just try try
it out, I copied one of my
[favorite scenes](http://youtube.com/watch?v=tzL10mgudaU) from Rocketman!
