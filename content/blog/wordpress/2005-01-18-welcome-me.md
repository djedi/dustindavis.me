Well, I've done it! I've finally taken the plunge and created my own blogspot.
I've seen them all oveer the web, and quite simply, I don't understand the
phenomenon. Maybe I will. I own serveral web sites and my own start-up
businesses that I quite often leave high & dry once my interest shifts - as it
often does. There are only a few interests that seem to remain constant over the
years. These are:<!-- more -->

1. Church (The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints)

2. Family

3. Computers

4. Baseball

Other than that, I could be anywhere as far as what I'm doing in my spare time
and what I'm thinking. Lately my thoughts have been centered on Affiliate
marketing. But that may pass and come again too. We shall see.
