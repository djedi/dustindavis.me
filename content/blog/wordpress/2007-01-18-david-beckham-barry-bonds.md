read
[this article on SI.com](http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/writers/frank_deford/01/17/beckham/index.html)
this morning about David Beckham coming to America to play soccer. It seems to
be all the buzz right now.

Personally, I could care less. I wouldn't care if soccer just went away. I find
it extremely boring. That's okay though. My favorite sport is baseball and I
realize that there are a lot more people in the world that find baseball boring
than there are people that find soccer boring.

But I enjoyed the article mostly because of the last paragraph that bridged the
two sports.

<blockquote>In the meantime, may we hope that some other country of the world with a struggling baseball league will decide that the way to make it work is to take Barry Bonds off our hands.</blockquote>
