Recently I've been on this honesty kick... I'm going through all my software
applications I use and either 1. registering them, 2. finding free or cheaper
alternatives, or 3. removing them and doing without.

The hardest has been doing without photoshop. I can't afford to buy such an
expensive program. So I've recently installed
[GIMP](http://gimp-win.sourceforge.net/) as a replacement. I understand it can
probably do most of the image editing that I would do with photoshop, but in a
completely different way.

So far I haven't gone through any tutorials, but after playing with it for a
while I've had moderate success. My most recent success is the creation of my
new Napoleon Dynamite blog header! What do you think?
