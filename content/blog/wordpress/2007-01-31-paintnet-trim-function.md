I'm really liking [Paint.net](http://www.getpaint.net). I certainly can't afford
[Photoshop](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Furl%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps%26field-keywords%3Dadobe%2Bphotoshop%26Go.x%3D0%26Go.y%3D0%26Go%3DGo&tag=ipod-zod-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)
and so I resorted to using free alternatives such as
[GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/windows/) and [Paint.net](http://www.getpaint.net).
There has been a slight learning curve though as I've had to get used to these
free tools.

One thing I found missing that I would often use in
[Photoshop](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Furl%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps%26field-keywords%3Dadobe%2Bphotoshop%26Go.x%3D0%26Go.y%3D0%26Go%3DGo&tag=ipod-zod-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)
is the trim function. This essentially allows you to remove the extra blank
space or white (or whatever color you choose) space around an image.

I've found a simple workaround to do what I need though.

Here it is, step-by-step:

Use the magic want to select the outside portion you want to trim.

Invert your selection:

And finally, crop to selection:
