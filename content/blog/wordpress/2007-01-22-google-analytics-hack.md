One thing that annoys me about many web analytics packages is that when they
report referring sites, they drop the GET request. So if you get a link from a
forum you have dig through their search results to find out what people are
saying about your site.

Reuban Yau has
[found a little hack](http://www.reubenyau.com/google-analytics-hack-obtaining-full-referring-url/)
that puts the full referring URL in your analytics report. I'm going to try it
out and see how well it works.
