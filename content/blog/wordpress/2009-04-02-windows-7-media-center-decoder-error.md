So for the past couple of weeks, I haven't been able to watch TV on my install
of Windows 7 beta. I though perhaps it was because I had installed some codecs
when I was playing with VirtualDub because I got this error:

<blockquote>

So I crawled around the Internet a bit and found
[this post](http://yellowduckguy.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!DA380C13569E8907!488.entry).
What? The error was very similar, but not quite the same, but I thought I'd
would try the recommended solution of setting my system clock back.

Go figure, it worked! This is stupid though because what good is it going to do
me with my system clock set back? The Guide is based on your system clock, so
obviously the channel listings are not going to be right.

Well, I'm certainly glad I didn't update [my media center pc](http://byomc.com)
to Windows 7! If anyone has a solution to get this working properly, I'd love to
know!

_UPDATE_

I found a solution to my problem
