Oh the dreaded Jacob 5, 77 verses long! While growing up, I never quite
understood this chapter. Even after a number of lessons in Sunday school and
seminary. I think we spent a couple days in seminary talking about it and all I
got out of it was what it meant to graft a branch into another tree, and how it
was done.

Then one day in Sunday school, we had a returned missionary, Brother Woodland,
that was just thrilled to give us the lesson on the aligory of the olive tree.
It was very easy to tell that the class was much less excited about the subject.
I don't think anyone in the room understood it. It's hard enough to teach a
bunch of high school kids, without having such a confusing topic.

Then it happened. We read a verse that opened it all up to me. I can't remember
exactly what the verse was, but I'm guessing it was
[Jacob 5:25](http://scriptures.lds.org/jacob/5/25#25)

<blockquote>And he said unto the servant: Look hither and behold the last. Behold, this have I planted in a good spot of ground; and I have nourished it this long time, and only a part of the tree hath brought forth tame fruit, and the other part of the tree hath brought forth wild fruit; behold, I have nourished this tree like unto the others.</blockquote>

After reading this verse our teacher explained that this verse talked about the
Nephites and Lamanites. After that one statement the whole aligory finally
opened up to me. I went home and read it and understood it all perfectly. I
understood the history of the house of Israel. I shared his excitement. I love
the aligory of the olive tree now!
