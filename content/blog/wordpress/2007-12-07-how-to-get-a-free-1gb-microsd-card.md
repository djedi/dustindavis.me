they are offering a
[Kingston 1GB microSD Secure Digital Card](http://affiliate.buy.com/gateway.aspx?sid=microsd&adid=17662&aid=10387719&pid=2267664&sURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.buy.com%2Fprod%2Fkingston-1gb-microsd-secure-digital-card%2Fq%2Floc%2F101%2F204134655.html&cjsku=202984127)
for only \$10 and free shipping. That's a sweet enough offer in and of itself,
but there is a way to get it free.

If you have never bought anything from Buy.com using
[Google Checkout](http://checkout.google.com), they offer \$10 your order for
doing so. So that's basically all there is to it. Buy the card with Google
Checkout and its free.

So what are you waiting for. This deals going to be gone by the end of the day!
