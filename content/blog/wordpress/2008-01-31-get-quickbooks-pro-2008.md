_**UPDATE: Since writing this post, Amazon has increased their price to
$169.99, but the coupon below still works so you can get it shipped for $149.99.**_

So I have a small business. After meeting with my accountant last night I
determined I really could make my life easier by using Quickbooks. I've tried
the free version and it's crap. So I figured I'd bite the bullet and shell out
\$200 for the pro version. Yeah, my business is growing, I guess it makes sense.

But being the budget conscious guy that I am, I figured I'd search the net for a
better deal. I was nearly ready to head over to Costco to buy it for
$150 plus tax, but after some further research I found a way to get it for $129.99 -
no tax, no shipping. Better yet, it's from Amazon so you know its the real deal.

It's simple really. Amazon has it listed for \$149.99. After adding it to your
cart, and before you checkout, add coupon code **UPINR5SC**
