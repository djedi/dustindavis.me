Recently it seems all my extended family is switching to
[DIRECTV](http://direct-vs-dish.com/directv/). We have all been
[Dish Network](http://direct-vs-dish.com/dish-network/) customers in the past.
The reasons vary, but many are similar.

**Why My Family Switched**

It has been almost two years now that we have been with
[DIRECTV](http://direct-vs-dish.com/directv/). We switched mainly due to
reception problems that we starting having out of the blue with
[Dish Network](http://direct-vs-dish.com/dish-network/). The technicians over
the phone were a waste of time. I got really frustrated with them. They wanted
to charge me to come out and look at the problem. I just told them to forget it
and I ordered [ DIRECTV](http://direct-vs-dish.com/directv/) online and had it
installed. When you make the switch you get all the latest hardware - most often
for free.

Our package for [ DIRECTV](http://direct-vs-dish.com/directv/) was essentially
the same price, but there are a couple channels we don't get that we had with
[ Dish Network](http://direct-vs-dish.com/dish-network/).

**My Mom Switched**

My mom has been a long time
[ Dish Network](http://direct-vs-dish.com/dish-network/) subscriber. She has
always paid for more channels that we normally get, and she was the first person
I knew that had a DVR and webTV. On occasion she will come to our house and baby
sit. While watching TV she really like the features of our TiVo system -
Especially watching two shows at once, or recording one show and watching
another.

She wanted to get this upgrade with her
[Dish](http://direct-vs-dish.com/dish-network/) package, but in the process of
pricing it, she also looked at [DIRECTV](http://direct-vs-dish.com/directv/). It
has long since been assumed that [DIRECTV](http://direct-vs-dish.com/directv/)
is more expensive, but she found that for the channels she was paying for, it
was actually cheaper. So making the switch was a no-brainer. She got all her
equipment and 4 rooms installed for free.

**My Mother-In-Law Switched**

My mother in law recently switched as well. I'm surprised it took them as long
as it did. They were having the same reception problems we were back when we
switched, but they stuck it out until things got better. They were never
completely better though. I remember a couple of occasions when it blacked out
during the Super Bowl! Arg! We had suggested several times that they make the
switch. They have had their equipment for about 10 years. Obviously their
biggest concern was the hassle of making a change.

Finally, after dealing with frustrations with their old hardware, and also
learning that for the channels they were paying for that they could get a better
deal with [DIRECTV](http://direct-vs-dish.com/directv/), they also made the
switch. They also got it installed in 4 rooms for free. They put DVRs in two of
those rooms. I overheard my mother-in-law explaining all she was getting from
[DIRECTV](http://direct-vs-dish.com/directv/) to her mother. I heard this
exclamation proceed from the kitchen, "And I'm paying \$xxx for Comcast!" So
soon my wife's grandma will also be a
[DIRECTV](http://direct-vs-dish.com/directv/) customer.

**The Complaints**

OK, I can't say it's all been a fairy tale ending there have been complaints.
The one I hear most - from everyone that has made the switch - is concerning the
guide. [Dish Network](http://direct-vs-dish.com/dish-network/) displays channels
in red that you are not subscribed to. This makes it really easy to see. With
[DIRECTV](http://direct-vs-dish.com/directv/) it is more of a guessing game. You
select a channel before it tells you that you don't have it. This was the case
12 years ago when my parents first ordered
[DIRECTV](http://direct-vs-dish.com/directv/) when I was in high school. I
thought back then that it was stupid, I think with all the advancements in 12
years they could have fixed this by now!

Other minor complaints are mainly with getting used to the "new" way of doing
old things.

**Making The Switch**

If you want to make the switch to [DIRECTV](http://direct-vs-dish.com/directv/),
I recommend [Expert Satellite](http://direct-vs-dish.com/directv/). Honestly,
you will find the same deals and promotions through any subscriber you go
through because [DIRECTV](http://direct-vs-dish.com/directv/) regulates that
with all their resellers. The one I went through is no longer doing service. My
mother-in-law used Expert Satellite and was thoroughly impressed with the whole
process. You can go to their [ website](http://direct-vs-dish.com/directv/), or
simply call them at 1-866-296-1516 (use promo code 777).

[Dish Network](http://direct-vs-dish.com/dish-network/) and
[DIRECTV](http://direct-vs-dish.com/directv/) side-by-side, I recommend visiting
