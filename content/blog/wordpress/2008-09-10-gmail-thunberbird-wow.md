I've been using Gmail as my main email client for about the past 4 years or so.
I currently have Thunderbird set up with SMTP to use for certain situations -
mainly when I want to copy and past images in - like showing screenshots to
people. (I still prefer the speed of the web app - and being able to make it
look like an app with Google Chrome/Google Gears is just that much sweeter)

Today I noticed something really cool. I got an email request from a client for
updates to his website. I was composing a reply in Thunderbird with screenshots
and all. In the process, I had a Gmail client open (in Google Chrome) and I was
reading his initial email again to make sure there wasn't something I missed.

At the bottom of the screen it said there was a new message with a link to
update the conversation. I've seen this before on rare occassions. I figured he
had sent me a follow up email. When I clicked the update link I saw the draft of
the message I was composing in Thunderbird - screenshots and all. How cool is
that?

Ok, maybe I'm over dramatic. But I thought it was neato!
