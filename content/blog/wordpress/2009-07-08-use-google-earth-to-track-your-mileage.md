Recently I've taken up hiking during lunch. There is a nice mountain trail
behind my house the I really enjoy. There are a few landmarks that I generally
try to make it to with the time I have available. I was curious exactly how far
those landmarks were so I used Google Earth to find out. Curious to know just
how accurate Google Earth was, I decided to test it out. I found a local high
school track and measured the path around it. .25 miles looks accurate to me!

To use this tool, click the ruler icon and use the path tab to draw polygon
shapes.
