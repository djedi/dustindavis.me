Have you ever tried surfing the new on a Pocket PC, Palm OS, or some other
handheld device? Some sites are designed to work well on a handheld, but most
are not.

Well, I've been to lazy to attempt the work I thought was necissary to make a
PDA friendly site. Now, it looks like a person can do it in 2 mintues with Mike
Davidson's tutorial. I think I'll give it a shot when I have 2 (or 30) minutes
to spare.

Check out Mike's tutorial at:
