My new goal is to read one book per month, the do a short review on that book. I
got this goal after becoming a huge [Dave Ramsey](http://www.daveramsey.com)
fan. I read his book, Total Money Makeover and loved it. Now I listed to his
free podcasts everyday.

One of the books he highly recommends is
[The Millionaire Next Door](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=ldspdacom-20%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=0671015206%2526tag=ldspdacom-20%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/0671015206%25253FSubscriptionId=0SJZR47BQGX60PK1RXG2)
by Thomas Stanley. This book will change the way you look at your next door
neighbor, and the way you may think while driving through an upper class
neighborhood. This book shows you how the tortoise continually beats the hair in
the race to building wealth.

The book does have it's boring parts and can often read like an owners manual
with lots of statistical data. But between all the stats and data the book can
be highly motivating to help you save instead of spend. You'll learn all about
PAWS & UAWS and what it means to have a big hat and no cattle.

Without going too much into it, I would say that although dull it is a good read
with lots of hard core statistical surprises.
