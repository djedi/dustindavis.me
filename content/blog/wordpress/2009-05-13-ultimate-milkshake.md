I play Ultimate Frisbee about three times per week during my lunch break. If it
weren't for competitive sports, I don't know how I would get my exercise. For
some reason, after playing ultimate or basketball I crave dairy. In the past I
would often stop at a grocery store on the way back to work and get a chocolate
milk, strawberry milk or drinkable yogurt. I have the luxury of working from
home now so I've found it very convenient to make milk shakes.

A friend told me about this
[Magic Milk Shake recipe](http://www.hillbillyhousewife.com/magicmilkshakes.htm).
I've made a few times and its pretty good. I like to add bananas and peanut
butter to mine. I've sort of played with the recipe and found shortcuts to make
the process quicker and I have the recipe down to 5 ingredients and its super
delicious. Today I measured what I generally add and I wrote it down so I could
share it:

- 1 cup water
- 16 ice cubes (from ice maker)
- 2 scoops hot cocoa mix (instruction on hot cocoa says to add 1 scoop to 6 oz
  of water)
- 1 banana
- 2 tablespoons peanut butter

Throw all this in a good blender and blend until smooth. I also added two
tablespoons of powdered milk today to make it a bit creamier, but I don't think
it is necessary. You can play with it all you want. The magic milk shake recipe
talks about adding oil for fat and cooking spray as an emulsifier. I've found
that by just using hot cocoa mix I don't need to add powdered milk, sugar, and
cocoa â€“ it's all there. I'm not an expert, but I think that adding the peanut
butter takes care of both from what I can tell.
