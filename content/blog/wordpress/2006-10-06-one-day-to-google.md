Wow, I'm impressed. On the same day that I set up this site, Google came to pay
a visit.

You can see from a screenshot of this
[whois record](http://whois.domaintools.com/nerdydork.com) the date that I set
up my nameservers. Speaking of which, DomainTools is pretty on the ball as well.

Looking at [Google](http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Anerdydork.com), it
seemed that on the same day they index a few sites. Well, it's a start!
