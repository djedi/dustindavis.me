I just finished the SEO quiz on seomoz.org. I got 200/255 - 79% so I guess they
consider me a "professional"

[SEO Professional - 79%](http://www.seomoz.org/)

[Are you an SEO Expert?](http://www.seomoz.org/seo-expert-quiz)

The problem is, I don't feel like a pro. Many of the answers I guessed and got
right, but honestly I never thought about them nor bothered to implement them. I
think what I may do is take all the answers (after you complete the quiz you
will get an answer sheet) and go through them one by and and apply them to one
of my sites. We'll see how well traffic increases to that site.

Maybe then after a bit of study I can go back and take the quiz again and be an
expert! ;)
