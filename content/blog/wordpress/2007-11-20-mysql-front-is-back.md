I was happy to receive an email this week from the author of MySQL Front. The
product is now [SQL-Front](http://www.sql-front.com/). So far, I don't know that
much is new other than the name change. The best part is that all license keys
still work â€“ better yet, if you once registered and lost your registration
information, you can easily [request it](http://www.sql-front.com/lostkey.html)
online. Since getting a new computer and not having MySQL Front available, I've
been getting use to the subtle differences of [SQLyog](http://www.webyog.com).
When I evaluated the two a few years ago I decided I liked MySQL front better,
plus it was \$10 cheaper for the registered version that included http tunneling
which I needed at the time. Welcome back SQL-Front!
