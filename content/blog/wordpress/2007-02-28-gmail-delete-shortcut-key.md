![Gmail Trash](http://www.nerdydork.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/gmail-trash.png)

I love Gmail, but I find it rather annoying that they feel you never **need **to
delete an email. It took them about 2 years to add the delete button. I don't
know why they didn't add a shortcut key with it. Certainly, they must have had
thousands of requests for it already.Well, I'm happy to report that you can get
a shortcut key to move your messages to the trash. But you will need the
following:

1. [Firefox](http://www.getfirefox.com)

2. [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/748/)

3. [Gmail Macros](http://blog.persistent.info/2005/12/greasemonkey-christmas.html)

What to do:

Install Firefox (if you are not using it already), then install the
[Greasemonkey extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/748/). Then download
the
[Gmail Macros script](http://persistent.info/greasemonkey/gmail-macros.user.js)
for Greasemonkey and
[read this post](http://blog.persistent.info/2005/12/greasemonkey-christmas.html)
carefully to learn how it works. Now you can press 't' (for trash) to move that
non-spam, unimportant message to the trash!
