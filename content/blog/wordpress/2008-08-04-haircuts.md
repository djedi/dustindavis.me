Wow, this really had me laughing out loud! Maybe because I just got a hair cut
from another weirdo on Saturday. I really wish I could find a normal person that
I could go to and get a haircut on a regular basis. Imagine captain Jack Sparrow
as an old lady with pig tails cutting your hair... yeah, that was my Saturday
morning.
