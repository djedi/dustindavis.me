title I know, because from all I know it can't really be done. But wouldn't it
be nice if you could delete a song directly from the iPod, so that when you're
out on the go, you can just drop a song you don't particularly like without
waiting until you get back to your computer to update iTunes and resync? Well I
do.

There are a couple of hacks though to help you remember to delete it later.

For example, you could give the song a one star rating. Hit the select button
twice while the song is playing then rotate to the number of stars you want. You
can then delete all your one-star songs at the next opportunity.

Another method is to hold the select button down on a song. This will add it to
an on-the-go playlist - which will give you list of songs to take action on.

For the bit more advanced, you can create a smart playlist which stores all your
one-star songs. This is sort of a combination of both techniques above.

Please, if anyone finds a hack that really can delete a song directly from the
iPod post it here. It would be nice if you could press the select button on a
song and get options for the song.
