description: The cash envelope system is not for everyone
---

Now let me preface this by saying I am a huge fan of Dave Ramsey and I see the
wisdom in all of his teachings. Now that said, I readily admit I don't follow
everything he says. One area in which I don't follow along is with the cash
envelope budget system.

I think the system is excellent. I do believe it "hurts" more to spend cash. It
is hard for me to break a `$20.` I like that fact that when I spend cash I
usually end up with change that becomes savings because I never spend change (I
don't know that Dave ever mentions that one, but it is a nice bonus).

My wife and I tried the cash envelope system. We gave up after only two months.
Here are the reasons why:

1. Inconvenience. Let's face it, debit cards make life so much more convenient.
   It is not convenient to got to the bank or ATM once or twice a month to
   allocate cash in your envelopes. I hate waiting in line at the bank so I
   avoid it at all costs. My credit union now allows me to scan checks from home
   and deposit them online - even less reason to ever go there.
2. Inconvenience. Yeah, same reason, but different. It is inconvenient to pay
   with cash. Grocery stores are not so bad really - unless you use the
   self-checkout, which I often do - again, because there is usually no lines
   there. Putting cash in those machines is downright painful. And really, who
   pays for gasoline with cash anymore?
3. Location of the envelope. It's happened on more than one occasion that my
   wife is making dinner and finds she is missing an ingredient. So what does
   she do? She calls me and asks that I pick it up on the way home from work. If
   I don't have enough blow money in my wallet I reach for the debit card.
4. Have you ever reached the checkout and when it is time to pay you realize you
   don't have your wallet. That is really mortifying to me. I'm frantic in that
   case. I start looking through my car for a hidden `$100` bill (it's never
   there) or a blank check (never there either). Even if I only live 3 blocks
   away it is inconvenient and super embarrassing. If you forget your envelope
   and you don't realize it before you get in line to checkout, are you really
   going to go home and get it? Not me, I'll pull out the debit card again. Of
   course my intention is to go back to the bank and deposit the amount of cash
   I spent, but I don't because that is so... inconvenient!
5. While it "hurts" me to spend cash, it seems to have the opposite effect on my
   wife. If money talks, all it ever says to my wife is "goodbye". I'm not being
   rude here. She readily admits this. It's not more difficult for my dear wife
   to spend cash than it is to spend money in any other way. In fact, I think it
   is sometimes easier for her. It seems to call out to her to be spent! OK, now
   I'm being rude :D.

Let's face it. I love debit cards. What I like about them is that if you use
your debit card as a debit card (as opposed to credit card) it withdraws the
cash out of your account immediately. Your bank account balance is updated
immediately (at least where I bank it is).

Here are some more things I love about my debit card:

1. It is free to use. I have a free checking account. I don't have to pay for
   new checks as long as I use my debit card.
2. My bank let's me customize it. I generally put pictures of my kids on it so
   people can tell me how cute they are. I sometimes wonder though if my bank
   would be opposed to me scanning in my drivers license so people don't have to
   ask for it when I use my debit card in place of a credit card. :)
3. It's thin. With all that cash, your wallet can become a pain in the butt -
   literally.
4. It doubles as a credit card. For those places that don't accept debit cards
   but can take credit cards, my debit card works fine. I generally have to wait
   a day or two for the transaction to appear on my bank statement though.
5. Did I mention it is convenient?

So, how do we make use of the timeless & effective envelope budget system with
debit cards? We use [Inzolo](http://inzolo.com).

Whenever I get income, be it a paycheck or any other form of income, I decide
where we are going to spend that money and allocate it to various virtual
envelopes.

Whenever we spend money using our debit card, the transaction imported lightning
fast into Inzolo and I specify what envelope that money came out of. I can
visually see all my envelope balances. If I go over in an envelope I can easily
move the exact amount I need to cover the difference from another envelope.

It's basically like haveing dozens of savings accounts set up in your bank and
deciding where each transaction will come out of. I can even split transactions
so that different portions come out of different envelopes.

Inzolo also has a [mobile web interface](https://m.inzolo.com). My wife and I
both have iPhones. So we can pull up our Inzolo account anytime and see our
envelope balances.

So if you love the idea of the cash envelope system, but don't feel you have the
will power to stick to it, I urge you to give [Inzolo](http://inzolo.com) a try.
