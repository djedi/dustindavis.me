The following is a review I posted two months ago on Google:

> Let me share a tale of sadness and frustration of first-world problems.

Now, here are my updates since then...

AutoSavvy Fixed all the error codes that were spawning from a bad front bumper
sensor. After some complaints and reminders of past issues, they gave me another
loaner vehicle to use while our car was in the shop.

After asking for all the reimbursements that AutoSavvy said they would give me
(two months of car payments, Ford service repairs and Time Dahle diagnosis,
which totaled $2,250.00) they sent me a check for $336.00. When I asked why that
amount and what about the rest of it, they didn't respond.

When we purchased the vehicle, I decided to buy the extended warranty this time.
The vehicle only came with one key. Our salesman said that if we wait 3 months,
then call on our warranty, we could get a key replacement. So I did that. After
calling, all seemed to go okay, then the warranty rep called me back and said
that she made a mistake. I didn't actually have key replacement coverage. I sent
a copy of of our contract showing it marked and she said I would have to talk to
the dealership.

I called AutoSavvy and left a message. Of course, they didn't return my call.
They never do. So I called again this morning and go someone on the line. I was
simply told "Warranties don't cover key replacements".

I said, "But my salesman said that it would, and my contract says it does."

"Sorry sir, warranties don't cover key replacements."

So asked to speak with someone higher up and she transferred me to a sale
manager. I was just sent to voicemail though with no name of whom I was leaving
a message for. I don't expect to hear back based on all my past experiences.

No we have a few issues with our car. My wife has an appointment for this week.
I'm guessing that none of it will actually be covered under warranty. I've left
a message with AutoSavvy's service department to ask if it will be or if I need
to take it to them to have it covered. I haven't heard back there either. I left
that message last week.

## Previous AutoSource / AutoSavvy Experience

This actually wasn't my first experience with AutoSource / AutoSavvy. I
purchased a 2016 INFINITI Q70L from their Post Falls, ID location. Here is my
Google review from that experience.

> I purchased a car here yesterday and it was one of the worst car-buying

>
> It had some bumper damage from some kind of accident while on the lot after

> their Utah location fix it (where I live), or negotiate a discount to have it
> fixed myself.
>
> I told Sally I would like them to have them fix the bumper in Utah as they

> actually they would prefer not to do that because the Utah location would just

> about selling out your own company). They offered to knock $300 off the price.
>
> I said, "you think it only costs $300 to replace a bumper on an INFINITI?"
> (she's the one that told me the whole bumper would be replaced). She said in a

>
> I said I still think it cost more that $500 to fix. I looked up online and saw

>
> She went back to her manager and after a time came back and said the best they

This car has been good, but I will tell you that I was going to live with the
bumper damage, but I didn't get to live too long with it.

My wife was pulling out of a drive way and the front bumper scraped the cement a
bit. A huge chunk of Bondo fell off and make it look horrible. Is it customary
to repair a bumper with Bondo?

We took it in and had it repaired and as I suspected, it was more that $600. It
was actually $1366.00 to have it repaired correctly.

## Stupid Tax

Stupid Tax is a term often used when you make a big financial mistake and just
have to learn from it. I figure there is more coming with repairs needed to our
Expedition right now, but so far, here is how much stupid tax I've paid by doing
business with AutoSavvy:

| Item                               | Amount      |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Q70L Bumper                        | 766.00      |
| Theft protection                   | 359.00      |
| Car Stereo                         | 2,000.00    |
| Tim Dahle Diagnosis                | 🔴 400.00   |
| Car Payments/no car                | 🔴 1,300.00 |
| Ford Service                       | 🔴 550.00   |
| Having to Purchase Another Vehicle | 7,752.00    |
| Purchase fees and warranty         | 3,925.00    |
| New Key for Expedition             | 🔴 300.00   |
| AutoSavvy Reimbursement            | +336.00     |
| **Total Stupid Tax**               | **17,016**  |

Let me pay this stupid tax so that you don't have to! Buying from AutoSavvy is
just not worth the risk.

If AutoSavvy wants to try to make any of this right (particularly the
highlighted 🔴 items that I was told I would be reimbursed for), I'm happy pull
down this post and my change my Google reviews, but I'm not holding my breath
and I'm ready to move on.
