Since I started writing Django, I've changed editors at least four times. In
windows, I started with the TextMate clone, E-text-editor. On mac I would use
[TextMate](http://macromates.com/). Both can use the
[django TextMate theme](https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/TextMate). When I
started using Ubuntu, I customized [gedit](http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/) to
work like e & TextMate. I even contributed to the
[gedit django theme](https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/gedit).

Now I use [PyCharm](http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) on every platform. I
wasn't able to find a django color theme, so I made my own. You can
[download it here](./pycharm-django.jar).

To install, open PyCharm and select File -> Import Settings... and select the
file.
