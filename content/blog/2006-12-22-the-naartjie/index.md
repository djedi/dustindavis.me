I thought I would take some time to educate my fellow Americans about the
naartjie. Why? Because I'm a nerd and a dork and that is what I do best.

I served a mission in South Africa from 1996-1998. There they had these little
oranges that were so much easier to peel - which made them so much more
delightful to eat.

Before my mission, I had never seen them in the states. I asked a few
missionaries about them and some said they had and said they were referred to as
mandarin oranges, tangerines, or even clementines. The only mandarin oranges I
knew about was those in the can and they were pretty much the same size as a
peeled naartjie.

Even since I've been home I haven't seen them much. Maybe it's just because I
don't look, or maybe they were not that popular in Utah.

A couple of years ago there appeared a new store in our local mall called
Naartjie. It's a
[children's clothing store](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naartjie_(clothing_retailer)>)
(Now, unfortunately bankrupt) and my wife was a big fan. I can't remember how
she mangled her pronunciation of the name, but I corrected her and explained
what a naartjie is.

Well, this Christmas, naartjies seem to be everywhere! Friends and family are
giving them to us in boxes like they are a new invention and telling us how
wonderful they are and easy to peel. So obviously I haven't been the only one
that hasn't noticed them in the past right?

Well, last night my mom gave us a box of them and as my wife and sister in law
were talking my wife referred to one as a naartjie. My sister in law had not
heard the term obviously and wondered where that name came from. Since my wife
considers most of the things I teach her as nerdy, unnecessary information to
retain, she couldn't remember where she heard that name. I was watching a
[football game](http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=263552483) and so I
wasn't there to expound my wisdom, but I did hear them ask my brother, who
served a mission in Spain what the Spanish word for orange was. When he said
_naranja_, I figured out what they were talking about. I remember thinking about
that cognate when I first heard the word naartjie in South Africa. I did take 2
years of Spanish in Jr. High. I don't remember much, but for some odd reason I
did remember the word for orange. That's when I dispersed my highly coveted
knowledge of what a naartjie is.

And now you know.

But what I would like to know is, where did the word "Orange" come from?
