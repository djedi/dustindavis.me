The greatest accomplishment I felt at the end of the year was completing my goal
of reading and listening to an average of 1 book per week, or 52 books in 52
weeks. I got the idea from a friend to accomplished this task in 2020.
Generally, I have set goals to read 1 book per month and I often don't hit that
goal. So this was a big, hairy, audacious goal for me! But, I really wanted to
do it.

## How I tracked my books

After setting this goal, I created a spreadsheet on Google Sheets. I listed a
number of books that I wanted to read throughout the year. The great thing about
having this goals was that I didn't feel like I had to be picky. Instead it was
more of a matter of trying to find books to add! All those audiobooks that I
have purchased with credits on Audible and haven't taken the time to listen to,
I could now add to my list.

The spreadsheet was pretty simple. I had the following columns for each book:

- Title
- Author
- ISBN
- My Rating
- Binding (Audiobook, Hard copy, Kindle)
- Total Minutes (audiobook)
- Pages (hard copy or kindle)
- Date Added
- Date Read

Some of the fields I added so I could export this list and
[import it into Goodreads](https://help.goodreads.com/s/article/How-to-import-my-books-from-other-cataloging-services-1553870934585).

This also helped me keep a stats tab to show how I was progressing on my goal. I
had an over/under number how many books I was ahead or behind my goal based on
the current week. The was calculated based on the date read column.

## Audiobooks

Throughout this post, I may say that I "read" a book, when I actually listened
to it. Please just go along with it! ðŸ¤“

I am not much of a reader. I don't enjoy reading and I get tired quickly when I
start reading. So, I figured the only way I would accomplish this goal was to
use audiobooks. Of course, not all books I wanted to read had an audiobook
available for it. In that situation, I either read the book, or I created an
audiobook to listen to!

I found that I could export Kindle books to basic text files. I created a script
that could then use text-to-speech to generate audio that I could compile into
an audiobook. Here is a
[blog post describing how I did that](https://dustindavis.me/blog/how-to-convert-ebook-to-audiobook).

I should mention that I updated the script to use Amazon Polly or Google
Text-to-speech API to get better text-to-speech output than the Mac `say`
command provides. You can use these API to convert up to 10K words per month for
free I believe.

Search my blog for [Audiobooks](https://dustindavis.me/blog/?q=audiobooks) to
see more posts about audiobooks, using Plex, and other topics I may add in the
future on the subject.

A few people have asked how I find the time to read so many books. Again, the
answer would have to be Audiobooks. I am busy and I don't think I would make the
time to read this much. The beauty of audiobooks is that I can often multi-task.
There are certain activities that don't require a lot of thinking that allow me
to listen to books and stay focused while also doing that task at hand. The most
common activies where I find I listen to audiobooks are:

- Driving
- Cleaning the house
- Doing yard work
- Exercising (lifting weights, treadmill, bike)

## Staying focused

The spreadsheet was really the best tool I had in staying focuses and motivated.
I used the
[Tab Snooze extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-snooze/pdiebiamhaleloakpcgmpnenggpjbcbm)
to open this spreadsheet on weekly basis to make sure I didn't forget to keep it
updated. But, generally when I finished a book, I was quick to update the
spreadsheet to see my goal progress.

## Stats

In 2021 I listed to 357 hours and 28 minutes worth of audiobooks! Granted, I
often listen around 1.5 speed so it probably took more like 238 hours. But
still, 238 hours! If you listed 8 hours per day to audiobooks, that would take
30 days.

I read three books with a total of 777 pages. (Jackpot).

This is not 100% accurate because there were a few of books that sometimes I
read and sometimes I listed, or, I started reading then converted the book to an
audiobook and finished by listening.

## Highlights

After I completed my 52nd book near the end of December, I posted my list of
books that I read on Facebook. The question I got asked the most was "What books
stood out the most" or "What are your top 5" or something similar. I think most
people look at the list as overwhelming and wanted to find a good read or two to
add to their list.

Because I have pretty diverse list of books, I found the question kind of hard
to answer. So here is my long winded answer...

### Favorite Book

There was one book on the list that I read twice. So I guess technically, I only
read 51 books in 2021. That book was The Book of Mormon. This is my favorite
book and I read it every day. So, it will be on my list every year and probably
will be read multiple times in a year. So if you have not read this book, this
would be the #1 book I recommend.

### Most Moving

Around Easter I read a few books focused on Jesus Christ. They were:

- Considering the Cross by Jake Hilton (6 hours 10 minutes)
- He Chose the Nails by Max Lucado (3 hours 35 minutes)
- Jesus the Christ by James E. Talmage (22 hours 42 minutes)

I had tried to read Jesus the Christ a couple of times when I was younger but I
never made it very far. Listening to the book was just what I needed. I could
not get enough of Christ. Yes, I have heard stories of Christ all my life. But,
during this time I was like a sponge. I just wanted more and more. It is hard to
really describe how these books affected me, but it was a spiritually moving
time of year for me.

### Most Surprising

The book that I was surprised that I liked so much was Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg. I
have read a few books about Habits such as Atomic Habits (which was I read a
second time in 2021), Habit Factor, Mini Habits. etc. I have heard the other
books quote BJ Fogg. I just didn't think there would be much new information in
this book. While reading the book, I wrote down a quote on a sticky note and it
is still posted on my monitor as I type this. The quote is: "I change best by
**_feeling GOOD_**, not by feeling bad." There were some really great nuggets in
this book and I will likely add it to my 2022 reading list.

### Most Impactful

I love Tim Ballard. I love what he is doing with Operation Underground Railroad.
I am familiar with his story and the individuals in Haiti that led him to start
O.U.R. because my father-in-law spent a lot of time in Haiti building an
orphanage for him.

I didn't realize that Tim was also a great author. He has three books that
really pulled me in and helped me see America in a greater light - the light of
covenant Israel.

I read three books in the following order:

- The Pilgrim Hypothesis by Timothy Ballard (6 hours 31 minutes)
- The Washington Hypothesis by Timothy Ballard (7 hours 39 minutes)
- The Lincoln Hypothesis by Timothy Ballard (7 hours 44 minutes)

I believe he wrote them in the reverse order, but I think reading them in
chronological order like this was helpful. I have a greater respect for the
pilgrims and Washington and Lincoln. I wish every American would read these
books. Sadly, I think many in this country today would not have any interest and
not even agree with them. But I found a lot of truth and light in these books.

Also, I later learned on [Relative Finder](https://www.relativefinder.org/) that
I am a direct descendent of some famous pilgrims.
[William and Mary Brewster](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Brewster_(Mayflower_passenger)>)
are my 12th great grandparents.
[William Bradford](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Bradford_(governor)>)
is my 11th great grandfather. I learned on Relative Finder that I am tied to a
lot of people I now have greater love and respect for. But the names listed
above were direct ancestors.
