Part of the reason I don't blog as much as I used to is not that I don't have
much to say, but rather it hurts too bad to say (type) it. I've been suffering
with RSI or Carpal Tunnel off & on for over 10 years. I've visited doctors,
bought all kinds of ergonomic helpers (keyboards, trackpads, doctor stools,
GeekDesks, wrist braces, pads, etc.) The effectiveness of each has been
debatable. At first I think it helps, then its effectiveness wears off as time
goes on.

It used to be that when it would flare up I'd start taking 800mg of Ibuprofen
2-3 times per day so I could continue working. A couple of months ago my whole
body started swelling up as I think the Ibuprofen combined with my Gleevec
(chemo pills) were taking their toll on my kidneys. I stopped taking Ibuprofen
figuring that dealing with the pain & swelling in my wrists was better than
knocking out my kidneys.

Two weeks ago I went to the doctor's office on a Saturday afternoon. I was
wearing wrist braces on both hands because they had become so sore and swollen I
could barely do anything without pain. I was icing my wrists every night before
bed. But this isn't what I was there for. I had been sick and my asthma was
acting up. After doing an albuterol nebulizer treatment and chest x-rays, I left
the doctor's office and picked up prescriptions for antibiotics (pneumonia),
albuterol (asthma), and prednisone (steroid for asthma). I started taking 40 mg
of prednisone each day for a week.

I was surprised that as I started taking prednisone, the swelling and pain went
away in my wrists. I asked my brother who is a doctor if prednisone helps RSI.
He said it certainly would, but it's a short term solution and you definitely
don't want to keep taking it.

After my week of prednisone the pain and swelling immediately came back in my
wrists. I can't tell you how frustrating that was. On Monday when I went into
work, I was determined to schedule an appointment with someone - anyone who
could possibly help me. I was past traditional medicine. I was now going looking
for alternative treatment - something I have never done before. I was looking at
chiropractors, massage therapists, acupuncturists, etc. I spend the whole
morning browsing around trying to decide which one to try first.

In the progress of researching I came across this post by Aaron Iba title
[How I Cured my RSI Pain](http://aaroniba.net/articles/tmp/how-i-cured-my-rsi-pain.html).
His whole story resonated with me. But when I got to the part where he started
describing how he finally cured his RSI I was quite confused and a little
skeptical. His cure - he read a book! What, that's crazy and impossible, right?

Well, you get to a point where you decide anything is possible. I turned my
attention to Dr. John E. Sarno to learn more about this. I was surprised that
there were so many people singing his praises. There must be something to this.

I watched two videos on YouTube (inserted below) and decided I was jumping in
with both feet. I bought the book Aaron mentioned in his blog,
[The Mindbody Prescription](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0446675156/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0446675156&linkCode=as2&tag=nerdydork-20) -
well, I actually bought the audio book with my
[Audible](https://dustindavis.me/audio-books.html) account.

I've listened to the audio book and this morning I bought another one of his
books -
[Healing Back Pain](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0446557684/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0446557684&linkCode=as2&tag=nerdydork-20),
which I just started listening to this morning. Those who follow my blog know
about
[my herniated disc experience](https://dustindavis.me/herniated-l5-s1-disc.html)
that I blogged about. To digress slightly I want to say that my back has been
feeling great. I did physical therapy and after about 3 months the numbness in
my leg and foot went away and I haven't really had any pain since then. When it
happened I really worried I would never be normal again, especially since the
specialists all told me they would be surprised if I didn't need surgery. Well,
I didn't need surgery. It turns out herniated discs can heal. I even played in a
softball tournament this summer and it didn't bother me at all.

It is now Friday, just four days since reading Aaron's blog post. I have removed
all my ergonomic crutches. I have been typing away like crazy and ignoring the
pain - which was really hard at first. The first two days I still had to wear a
wrist brace on my right hand so I could work faster and ignore the pain better.
I have since put my braces and everything else in a drawer - out of sight. The
swelling has gone down, my range of motion has increased and the pain is about
60% gone from where it was. Considering where it was, that is HUGE for me!

So I'm writing this post for a few reasons:

1. Because I can! It doesn't hurt to do so.
2. To document a starting point. It has only been four days, but I totally
   anticipate being 100% pain-free at some point in the future. I don't want to
   put a time limit on it.
3. To share with others who might be going through RSI or carpal tunnel issues.

The confusing point is with this "cure" there is no real defined solution. I'm
sure this post is confusing to someone looking for the cure. Basically it is the
knowledge that your brain is triggering this problem and you need to convince
your subconscious that you're not going to let this happen anymore. It is the
knowledge that becomes the power of the cure. I know it totally sounds crazy,
but it's crazy to me that I sweat and blush when I get nervous in front a crowd.
Yes, my brain can control my body and I'm telling my subconscious brain to
chillax on my wrists already.

It is working.

## UPDATE 2013-01-11

It's been over 3 months and so I thought I should post an update. It took a
couple of weeks, but since then I have been pain-free. There have been some
minor pain in my wrists at full extension on occasion, but they generally go
away. An odd phenomenon did occur. After my wrist pain went away, my lower back
starting hurting. In Mindbody Prescription, Dr. Sarno warns you that the pain
will likely move to a new location as your brain realizes its pain defense
mechanism isn't going to work on this particular body part anymore. I just
applied the same principles - generally laying down and meditating on what could
be bothering me emotionally and telling my brain to send oxygenated blood to the
sore part of my body. After the pain left my lower back my wrists started to act
up but the pain went away quickly, then it moved to my upper back and made
things difficult for about a week and a half. The same principles applied.

I told my boss about this book. She read it and applied it to her migraines she
would experience about 2-3 times per week. At our next 1 on 1 she said she was
30 days without a migraine! She also gave me some tips that she had learned in
the past from a therapist. We discussed some emotional triggers from my teenage
years. After that meeting my upper back pain went away and I haven't had any
issues since.

Now I try to share this information with everyone I can. I get some strange
looks sometimes, but I'm just trying to help.  I think the people who are
willing to try it first are those who have tried everything else and are
desperate for some pain relief.

## UPDATE 2014-04-18

I thought I'd share a few more updates. This update mainly addresses back pain.
I haven't had any RSI pain in the past year. I mentioned earlier that my back
healed and I was playing softball and basketball. I happened to re-herniate my
disk on a "pioneer trek" where I helped you push heavy handcarts up steep hills,
hiking 8 hours a day for 3 days and sleeping on a sagebrush. By the third day I
woke up and couldn't move my back. I continued to walk all that day and by the
end of that day I was in excruciating pain and I was losing feeling in my left
leg.

I went through all the physical therapy and exercising as I did the first time.
It has been 10 months now and while the back pain has gone away, I still don't
have feeling in the anterior of my left leg and foot. It feels like I constantly
have Novocain injected in my leg. I lost strength in that leg as well. I
couldn't lift my body on my left calf for about 5 months. I am regaining the
strength now, but I still don't have feeling back.

The good news I want to emphasize is that I'm not in pain! This really surprised
my back surgeon. He is about 80 years old (at least it seems it to me) so he has
seen a lot of backs. He was shocked based on my MRI that my pain went away. He
thought I would for sure need a microdiscectomy after my MRI. But after 90 days
and being pain-free he said that the surgery may or may not help the nerve
damage, but he didn't recommend it if I wasn't in pain.

So I know I have real physical damage in my back. But that doesn't mean I have
to live with constant pain.

One other resource I found was a
[book by Scott Brady title "Pain Free For Life"](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001JK9BF0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001JK9BF0&linkCode=as2&tag=nerdydork-20).
Dr. Brady found pain relief through Dr. Sarno's methods and then developed
techniques to help his patients recover from chronic pain. I wish there were an
audiobook for this one.

One last thing... I noticed an interesting side effect from on this mind-body
magic. I was not sick one day in all of 2013. My wife and four kids got sick a
number of times but I never caught it. I'm used to getting sick at least once or
twice a year. But while I was focusing on these mind-body techniques I
surprisingly never got sick. Coincidence? Maybe.
