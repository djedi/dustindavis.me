  The miracle product that removed the ballpoint pen ink from our new sofa
---

My wife called me hysterical last week. Our two-year-old daughter had written
all over every cushion of our brand new sofa. This sofa is a red microfiber
sectional. It was this year's tax return 101 costing around `$2300`. I asked her
to calm down for her sake and I went straight to Google. Surely we can't be the
only ones with terrible two-year-old writing on a brand new microfiber sofa with
a blue ballpoint pen! :) I was write (sorry for the typo...)

I found the following:

Well, I found the Carbona near the laundry detergent section in Albertsons. It
worked all right. It took a while rubbing out all the ink, but it's out and we
are greatly relieved. My wife has since thrown away all the pens, crayons, etc
in the garbage.

Thank you, Andy, whoever you are! And, thank you Carbona.
