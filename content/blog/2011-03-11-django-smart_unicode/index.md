description: Use Django's `smart_unicode` function to solve unicode errors
---

So my QA guy is putting an app through the ringer and presented me with the
following error on a page:

> Caught UnicodeEncodeError while rendering: ('ascii',
> u'Utf8-\u010a\u010e\ufffd"\u0117', 5, 8, 'ordinal not in range(128)')

For some reason I thought UTF8 characters Just Workedâ„¢ in Django, but that was a
bad assumption. The problem came from my model's `unicode` def:

```python
def unicode(self):
    return " ".join([self.first_name, self.last_name])
```

Luckily Django provides a simple fix for this problem.

```python
from django.utils.encoding import smart_unicode

def unicode(self):
    return smart_unicode(" ".join([self.first_name, self.last_name]))
```
