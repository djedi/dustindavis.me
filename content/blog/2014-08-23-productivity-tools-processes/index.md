**2020 UPDATE**

I currently use [Todoist](https://todoist.com/r/dustin_davis_vhlbue) because it
works great across all my various devices. I also have switched to
[Productive](https://www.apalon.com/productive.html) for my habit tracking
because I like to have an AM and PM habit list.

See my [Uses](/uses/) page for my most up-to-date list of productivity tools.

Last week as I was driving to a user group meeting, I listed to a
[podcast episode](http://www.smartpassiveincome.com/email-management/). The
subject was managing email. Since then I have cleaned up my inbox and I have
been at inbox zero or close to it all week. Between my 5 email accounts I have 1
message in my inbox right now. I'm used to having thousands of emails in my
inbox, half of them unread.

One thing that has helped is that I have determined that my inbox is a terrible
todo list. I have started using [Wunderlist](https://www.wunderlist.com/) more
to manage my daily tasks.

Generally I’ll start my morning by looking through my todo list in Wunderlist.
I’ll set due dates on all the items I want to get done today and set the due
date as today. Wunderlist has an automatic category named Today where I can see
all the tasks I have set as due today.

I generally try to have no more than 10 tasks. Some are long tasks, some are
simple. My goal is to get through the task list for the day. I work on one until
I check it off, then I work on another I generally get about 5-6 task done in a
day leaving 4-5 left that are still in my today list the next day because they
are now marked as overdue. I generally just mark them as due today, or leave
them as overdue and because they show up in red they tend to get a higher
priority.

So as I go through my emails, if there is something that I need to take action
on, I move it into my todo list. Basically, the only thing that stays in my
inbox is a message that I need to reply to and I can’t just reply quickly to.
Either it needs some thought or action first. But, if it needs some action
first, I will generally put it in my todo list and then find the email later and
reply after I complete the todo task.

For email I have been using a combination of [Airmail](http://airmailapp.com/),
[Gmail](http://gmail.com), and I just got the beta of
[Mailbox](http://www.mailboxapp.com/) for Mac, which have been using on my
iPhone and I really like it. Each client has it’s pros & cons, but I think I'll
save that topic for another day.

Last night I listed to a talk from [Nathan Barry](http://nathanbarry.com/) from
[MicroConf 2014](http://www.microconf.com/). It was a good reminder of the power
of habits and doing things on a daily basis. He actually wrote an iPhone app to
track your habit goals and your streak. I looked at it and ultimately decided on
a different one named [Habit List](http://habitlist.com/). Today is my first day
using it but so far I really like the flexible features. For example, some habit
I may only want to do on Mon, Wed, Fri. Some habits I want to do 5 days a week,
but it doesn't matter which days. Habit List supports these features. I just
really wish they had a desktop app to go with it like Wunderlist.

Hopefully I can develop some good habits and report back later that the
productivity apps and processes are still working.
