Need to stop procrastinating and get something done? Follow these steps to help
you get your task complete ASAP!

1. Check your email. There might be an important message you need to read. Until
   you have read all your email, your mind will not be clear enough to get
   anything done.
2. Open Twitter and read through at least 100 status updates. Perhaps someone
   you follow is being productive and tweeting about it. This will motivate you
   to be productive as well.
3. Open Facebook and read the latest news feed from the past 48 hours (or until
   caught up). Perhaps an old friend you haven't seen in years is doing
   something cool or important and this will provide motivation for you.
4. Check your RSS aggregator. I recommend Google Reader. There may be a really
   good article you need to read that will help you be more productive today.
5. Check any statistics that might be relevant or interesting. These could
   include: websiteÂ analytics, affiliate commission reports, bank account
   balances,
   <shameless_plug>[Inzolo envelope balances](http://inzolo.com)</shamelss_plug>,
   sports team stats & highlights, etc.
6. Check the most recent news. You can do this by looking at news.google.com, or
   through your favorite local television, radio, or newspaper site. There might
   be exciting news that wasn't covered in Twitter or Facebook that you don't
   want to miss. If so, be sure to share this news on Twitter and Facebook.
7. Get something to eat. By now you are probably hungry. Get something that you
   can eat while sitting in front of your computer. Just type with one hand. You
   can still be productive.
8. Get "fun" out of the way. If you have any favorite games, play them for a bit
   to get the fun out of your system. You are about to get into some not-so-fun
   work, so might as well get it in now. If you don't have any favorite games,
   try one of the following: Solitaire, Minesweeper, Bejeweled, Zuma's Revenge,
   Plants vs Zombies, or whatever happens to be pre-installed on your operating
   system.
9. Help others. While getting your stuff done may sound appealing, help others
   first and your stuff will take care of itself. You can do this by answering
   stack overflow questions, hanging out on relevant IRC channels, and
   responding to questions on Google Groups & other forums. Remember, you're not
   only helping others, your gaining karma and in some cases POINTS so take the
   time to get give well researched answers. Oh, and be sure to stay logged in
   to all instant messaging protocols (Google Talk, YIM, AIM, MSN IM, Jabber,
   Facebook Chat, etc). You want to make sure that you are there for questions
   your friends and co-workers have at a moment's notice.
10. Write a blog post sharing your own favorite productivity tips so all can
    benefit from your experiences (good & bad).
