Well, I've done it! I've finally taken the plunge and created my own
~~blogspot~~. I've seen them all over the web, and quite simply, I don't
understand the phenomenon. Maybe I will. I own several web sites and my own
start-up businesses that I quite often leave high & dry once my interest
shifts - as it often does. There are only a few interests that seem to remain
constant over the years. These are:

1. Church (The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints)
2. Family
3. Computers
4. Baseball

Other than that, I could be anywhere as far as what I'm doing in my spare time
and what I'm thinking. Lately, my thoughts have been centered on Affiliate
marketing. But that may pass and come again too. We shall see.

## Update 2020-09-02

I found this post while migrating to Gatsby. I decided to leave it since it was
over 15 years old and my first blog post ever.
