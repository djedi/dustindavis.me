We've recently been trying to potty train our two-year-old daughter. We try to
be really positive and congratulate her when she uses the toilet.

We had all been shopping for a couple hours at Target for a new baby that should
arrive soon. While I was checking out, my wife took our daughter with her as she
went to the restroom.

Being the inconspicuous soul she is, my wife was quite embarrassed when she was
done and our daughter yelled in delight for all to hear, "Yay! Mommy went
poo-poo."
