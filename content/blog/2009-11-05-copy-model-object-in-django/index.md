description: How to copy a database record in Django
---

I ran into a situation where I wanted to created a new database record from an
existing record (model object). I figured there should be a fairly simple
solution. It turns out there is and I want to thank `Seveas` on IRC #django for
pointing it out for me. This is essentially what I did:

```python
from copy import deepcopy
old_obj = deepcopy(obj)
old_obj.id = None
old_obj.save()
```

Voila!
