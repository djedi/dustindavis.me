I really like [Jeff Francoeur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Francoeur). I
suppose he'll take over as my favorite player after
[Chipper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipper_Jones) retires, just as Chipper
took over for the gap left by [Murph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale_Murphy)
when he won my respect his rookie year. Why Francoeur? I'm not totally sure. I
know it has nothing to do with my wife thinking he's the cutest guy on the team.
I think it is because he reminds of how I play baseball - very aggressive at the
plate hoping to get lucky :D

Well I've noticed that in a few of his
[photos](http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/atl/images/fan_forum/wallpapers/1024x768_atl_francour2.jpg)
he has [Joshua 1:9](http://scriptures.lds.org/en/josh/1/9) written on the back
of his batting glove.

> Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid,
> neither be thou dismayed: for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou
> goest.

Pretty cool, I think.
