description: Old song from 2nd grade that sits in my head...
---

My daughter came home from pre-school singing a turtle song with a familiar
tune. The tune came from a song I used to hear a lot back when I was in the
second grade. I tried to google it to find the "official" lyrics, only to learn
there seems to be no official lyrics - every
[version](http://www.kayshapero.net/child2.htm) I
[found](http://kilowan.wordpress.com/2006/09/02/skeeters-and-the-bed-bugs/) on
the internet seemed to be noticeably different. So, I decided to post it as I
remember it:

> I woke up Sunday morning  
> I looked up on the wall  
> The beetles (or skeeters) and the bed bugs  
> Were playing a game of ball
>
> The score was six to nothing  
> The beetles (or skeeters) were ahead  
> The bed bugs hit a home run  
> And knocked me out of bed!
>
> I'm singing Eenie meenie and a...  
> Minie mo mo mo mo  
> Catch a whippa-whoppa  
> By the toe, and if he...  
> Hollers hollers hollers  
> Let him go. I'm singing  
> Eenie meenie and a... Minie mo!
>
> I wend downstairs for breakfast  
> They served me bacon and eggs  
> I ate up all the bacon  
> The eggs ran down my legs!
>
> I'm singing Eenie meenie and a...  
> Minie mo mo mo mo  
> Catch a whippa-whoppa  
> By the toe, and if he...  
> Hollers hollers hollers  
> Let him go. I'm singing  
> Eenie meenie and a... Minie mo!
>
> My mother is a baker  
> My father cuts up meat  
> And I'm a little hot-dog  
> Running down the street!
>
> I'm singing Eenie meenie and a...  
> Minie mo mo mo mo  
> Catch a whippa-whoppa  
> By the toe, and if he...  
> Hollers hollers hollers  
> Let him go. I'm singing  
> Eenie meenie and a... Minie mo!
>
> I jumped into the sewer  
> And that's where I will die  
> Some people call it murder  
> But I call it sewer-cide!
>
> I'm singing Eenie meenie and a...  
> Minie mo mo mo mo  
> Catch a whippa-whoppa  
> By the toe, and if he...  
> Hollers hollers hollers  
> Let him go. I'm singing
