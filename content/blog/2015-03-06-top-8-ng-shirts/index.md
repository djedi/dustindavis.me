I love collecting t-shirts at programming conferences. So far I've gotten some
good ones at ng-conf. Here are the eight shirts I added to my wardrobe. Counting
down to my favorite.

## 8. CDK Global

These guys were awesome to put a t-shirt in every swag bag so you didn't have to
go ask for it. Unfortunately it is my least favorite because it is black. Two
words, beard dandruff.

## 7. ng-conf

This is the shirt everyone got in their swag bad. It is a nice simple design. I
like the shirt fabric much better than last year. This year, the shirt is white
print on a gray shirt. It's a nice minimalistic design that I like, but I feel
like a race car driver with all the logos not the back of the shirt. But hey,
thanks to the ng-conf sponsors!

## 6. Domo (T-Shirt)

A nice soft t-shirt. Gray with Domo logo on the front and Domo careers XML on
the back.

## 5. Capital One Tech

I had the choice of red or blue. I kind of wish I went with red since I have a
few other blue shirts. This has a nice simple logo, again with a nice soft
fabric.

## 4. AirPair

This was the only light-colored shirt I saw so it stands out a bit more. Great
fabric with two-color print. There was a catch to get this shirt - you had to
sign up on their website. But that wasn't a problem because I would have anyway.
They have an interesting service where I can get paid to mentor someone on the
things I have expertise in. Or, I could find a mentor to help me out with a
project.

## 3. Firebase

Nice soft blue t-shirt. I love that this was designed custom for this event with
the year on it. I like the snowflake in the background of the Angular logo -
giving it a touch of Salt Lake City. I also got a nice yellow beanie with the
Firebase logo.

## 2. Domo (Soccer shirt)

This has to have been the most expensive shirt being handed out at the
conference. Many people would probably put this shirt #1 on the list. But I'm
not a soccer fan. Had it been a baseball jersey, easily #1 on this list!

## 1. Ionic Framework

I got this same shirt last year and I wore it all the time. I love the minimal
and interesting logo. Unfortunately I left it in a condo in St. George a few
months ago when we took a family trip to hike Zion National Park. I found out
about this shirt on twitter and found
[Mike Hartington](https://twitter.com/mhartington/status/573609393167593472) and
he hooked me up with a new shirt.

Note: There were other t-shirts being handed out of course, but I didn't get one
either because I didn't know about it, or it didn't look like something I'd wear
(black shirt with colorful bubbles all over it, for example)
