My wife loves to decorate. She has a keen eye and knows exactly what she wants.
Generally that means scouring the internet for something she can hang on our
wall somewhere.

If I can buy a hi-res image, then great. If not, then I'm left figuring out how
to make it the right size and scale it big enough to print.

Here is today's example that she found on
[Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Priscilla_and_John_Alden_%2871565%29.jpg):

She is a descendant of John and Priscilla Alden, so she would like an 8x10 image
printed for Thanksgiving decor.

The challenge is that if you were to crop it to 8x10, you would have to cut off
their feet. She wanted it expanded. Years ago, this would have been nearly
impossible to make look decent. Now with AI, we have more options.

I used Photoshop to crop and then expand the image and remove the handwriting on
the side. I then had this image that I used in the next step:

I tried various tools: Midjourney, ChatGPT, Grok, and finally got a decent
result with Google Gemini. But I first had to expand it to 4:5 (8:10) ratio and
tell it to fill in the white areas.

Here is what Gemini created:

I removed the Gemini watermark, then ran it through Topaz Gigapixel to upscale
it to a higher resolution. I have an old version of the software that I use
sporadically—not enough to justify keeping a regular subscription.

Here is the final image ready to print (click to download full resolution):
