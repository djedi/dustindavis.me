description: A quick review of Webfaction hosting
---

**UPDATE: Since writing this review, I have set up two accounts with
**[**Webfaction**](http://www.webfaction.com/?affiliate=redseam)**.
**[**Check out my latest review**](/blog/webfaction-review)**.**

I've seen a lot of recommendations for
[Webfaction](http://www.webfaction.com/signup?affiliate=redseam) for new Django
developers who want an easy to use hosting solution. As you can see from
previous posts that I have a VPS that I've set up Django on. I was having
problems getting one of my applications to work, and I wondered if it was
because of my setup. So I decided to try out
[Webfaction](http://www.webfaction.com/signup?affiliate=redseam). After all,
they offered a 60-day money-back guarantee. So I signed up and set up my
account. I must admit it was much easier to set up than my VPS, plus I could
choose to use Python 2.5 (which was never really able to get working on my
server setup) and you can use mod_python or WSGI. I was quite impressed with
their setup options and the ease of setup. It turns out there there was a
problem in my code because I ended up getting the same error on their servers as
I did mine. I was just confused because it was working on my windows development
machine, by not my Linux servers.

So having lost the need for
[Webfaction](http://www.webfaction.com/signup?affiliate=redseam), I decided to
exercise their money-back guarantee. I think this was the best part of the
process. I sent them an email. The responded quickly telling me how to cancel
the account from the control panel. I think within a half hour I had the money
back in my PayPal account and an email confirmation letting me know and saying
thanks for trying their service.

Surely, If I ever need another Django host or if it comes to the point where I
need to use the latest version of Python, I will look to
[Webfaction](http://www.webfaction.com/signup?affiliate=redseam). If I have a
client looking for hosting, I will recommend
[Webfaction](http://www.webfaction.com/?affiliate=redseam).
