I’ve recently created a couple of scripts that will download and convert videos
on YouTube to Plex.

What You Need My script makes use of other great tools. Follow the instructions
on the links below to install them on your system.

- youtube-dl
- ffmpeg
- wget
- imagemagick

I’m using a mac. I just used brew to install these packages:

```bash
brew install youtube-dl ffmpeg wget imagemagick
```

## Downloading Videos

The following script will change directories to my preferred plex video location
and then download the video to that location. I run this script like so:

youtube2plex <youtube_url>

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Personalization
PLEX_DIR="/Volumes/Media/Videos/YouTube Downloads"

# download the file and move it to the NAS for Plex to pick up
cd $PLEX_DIR
youtube-dl $1
cd -
```

## Downloading Audios

In another post I explained how I use Plex for audiobooks. I love the Prologue
app. I will often use this script to convert YouTube video (such as BYU
Speeches) to audio so I can listen to them in my prologue app. Yes, I could go
to BYU speeches and download the audio, but this does more. It puts in the
metadata as well as downloading a thumbnail of the video and cropping it to a
square image so it looks good in my app.

With this script I can simply run:

youtube2prologue <youtube_url>

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Personalization
DOWNLOAD_DIR="/Users/dustin/Downloads"
PLEX_DIR="/Volumes/Media/Audiobooks/YouTube Downloads"

# Not sure how to automatically get Artist name, so I'll just ask for it.
echo "Metadata Artist: "
read ARTIST

# Put everything in my downloads directory
cd $DOWNLOAD_DIR

# Get variables to use later
FILENAME=$(youtube-dl -f "mp4" --get-filename $1)
NEW_FILENAME=$(youtube-dl --get-filename -x -o '%(title)s.mp3' $1)
TITLE=$(youtube-dl --get-title $1)
echo $FILENAME
echo $NEW_FILENAME
echo $TITLE
THUMB_URL=$(youtube-dl --get-thumbnail $1)

# Download thumbnail and crop it to a square
wget $THUMB_URL -O cover.webp
dwebp cover.webp -o cover.png
convert -define jpeg:size=256x256 cover.png -thumbnail 256x256^ -gravity center -extent 256x256 cover.jpg

# Download the video in mp4 format
youtube-dl -f "mp4" $1

# Convert to MP3 (Doing this manually because filenames were not consistent with youtube-dl)
ffmpeg -i $FILENAME -vn -ar 44100 -ac 2 -b:a 192k -metadata title=$TITLE -metadata album=$TITLE -metadata artist=$ARTIST -metadata album_artist=$ARTIST temp.mp3

# add cover art
ffmpeg -i temp.mp3 -i cover.jpg -map 0:0 -map 1:0 -c copy -id3v2_version 3 -metadata:s:v title="Album cover" -metadata:s:v comment="Cover (front)" $NEW_FILENAME

# Move the final file to NAS for Plex to pick up
mv $NEW_FILENAME $PLEX_DIR

# housekeeping
rm temp.mp3
rm $FILENAME
rm cover.*
cd -
```
