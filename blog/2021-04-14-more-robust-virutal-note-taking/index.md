After I got my first iPad, a friend recommended a note-taking app called
[Noteability](https://www.gingerlabs.com/). I purchased it but never really used
it.

Fast forward 6-7 years and I find myself using it at least weekly. I've learned
that I can import Google Docs and them write all over them with my apple pencil.
This is a game changer!

I have weekly meetings where I generally get a print out of the agenda. I would
take notes on the agenda and generally forget about the paper. Now I request
that no agenda is printed. Instead, I just import it into Noteabilty from
[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com). I can then take notes on it in various
colors, make highlights, etc. I can edit those notes as needed. I then take all
those notes and use them for action items. It has been great.

I would like to say I thought of the idea myself, but someone else in the
meeting got a new iPad and started doing this with
[Goodnotes](https://www.goodnotes.com/). As he was telling me about all the
features, I found I had the same features in Noteability, so I didn't bother
purchasing another app.

If you want to see the differences between Goodnotes and Noteability, I found
there are
[lots of comparisons out there](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=goodnotes+vs+notability).

## Scriptures

Recently I learned someone was using Goodnotes as their scripture study tool.
This is cool! Now you can have the same format of scriptures as others with the
ability and hightlight and write in margins, etc., as you would with real
scriptures. Here are some tips to get started:

1. Download the scriptures in pdf format. You can google this, but here is link
   to the
   [Book of Mormon](https://media.ldscdn.org/pdf/lds-scriptures/book-of-mormon/book-of-mormon-34406-eng.pdf),
   for example.
2. Use [DeftPDF](https://deftpdf.com/resize-pdf) to resize the pages of the PDF
   to add more room in the margins. This makes it easier to write all the notes
   you want on each page. On mone, I added 1.5 inches on the left and the right.
   You simply upload the PDF, add additional margins, then download the new PDF.
3. Import your new PDF into Noteability or Goodnotes. I used Airdrop on my mac
   and my iPad accepted and prompted me to open it in Noteability. It was that
   simple.

I hope these tips give you some ides for better note-taking it our amazing
digital world.
