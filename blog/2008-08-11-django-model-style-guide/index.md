description: The preferred order of Model classes and methods
---

(This post is mostly for my own reference)

James Bennett mentions a Django style guide in his book
[Practical Django Projects](https://amzn.to/2RwomCS).

I couldn't find reference to it, but the following is the order of things when
it comes to models:

1. Any constants and/or lists of choices
2. The full list of fields
3. The Meta class if present
4. The Admin class if present
5. The **unicode**() method
6. The save() method, if its being overridden
7. The get_absolute_url() method, if present
8. Any additional custom methods
