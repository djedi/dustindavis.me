We bought a shed kit from a local place in Garland Utah named
[Sturdy Built](https://goo.gl/maps/SSEJowQbi5fqsXqa6). Our friends recommended
them. My wife called to get a quote and learned they were 8 months out before
they could build, but only a month out if we ordered a kit and built ourselves.
Plus, we could save some money by building it ourselves.

The best option is to have them build it on site and deliver it, but where we
live on a mountain side it just wasn't an option.

## Day 1 - Thursday

We had them load up the kit on our ATV trailer. We parked it in the driveway and
covered it. I'm glad we did. We had a big rain & wind storm.

## Day 2 - Friday

I figured this would be at least a two-day project. So I took the day off work
to get started. Here are the photos and progress from day 1.

{% responsiveImage "./images/1-3.jpg", "", "", 720, "" %}

I originally had the skids too far apart so I had to move them both in 1 foot
and re-level everything.

{% responsiveImage "./images/1-4.6.jpg", "", "", 720, "" %}

{% responsiveImage "./images/1-5.jpg", "", "", 720, "" %}

{% responsiveImage "./images/1-6.jpg", "", "", 720, "" %}

{% responsiveImage "./images/1-8.jpg", "", "", 720, "" %}

{% responsiveImage "./images/1-9.jpg", "", "", 720, "" %}

Laying out the door and window as a little complicated. I had to call the owner
for some tips.

I didn't have any hurricane ties for the rafters so I decided to call it a day.
I was exhausted and had plans to go watch the high school football game.

## Day 3 - Saturday

I got my son to help me tie on the rafters and and set the roof.

{% responsiveImage "./images/2-1.jpg", "", "", 720, "" %}

{% responsiveImage "./images/2-2.jpg", "", "", 720, "" %}

{% responsiveImage "./images/2-3.jpg", "", "", 720, "" %}

{% responsiveImage "./images/2-4.jpg", "", "", 720, "" %}

My friend showed up to help with the roofing!

{% responsiveImage "./images/2-5.jpg", "", "", 720, "" %}

{% responsiveImage "./images/2-6.jpg", "", "", 720, "" %}

{% responsiveImage "./images/2-7.jpg", "", "", 720, "" %}

{% responsiveImage "./images/2-8.jpg", "", "", 720, "" %}

It got too dark to finish, so we cleaned up and called it a night.

## Day 4 - Monday

I got the shingles finished and installed the door. The door was a struggle. It
was very heavy. It was quite dark when I finished so I snapped another photo in
the morning.

{% responsiveImage "./images/3-2.jpg", "", "", 720, "" %}

Now all that is left is paint and installing the side vents.
