A few years ago, I set a goal to read
[52 books in 52 weeks](52-books-in-52-weeks). I got so much out of it that I
decided to do it again and again. When people hear that I have read a book a
week, usually the next question is, "Which books were your favorite?" or "Which
do you recommend?"

## Biggest Surprise

Someone loaned me a copy of Financial Fitness by Chris Brady and Orrin Woodward.
I have read a lot of personal finance books over the years. I didn't think that
I would learn much new from this one, but I actually really enjoyed it. It talks
about the offense and defense and playing field when it comes to personal
finance. It is kind of like reading 3 books in one. With the defense, it is
information much like you would get from Dave Ramsey. With the offense, it is
similar information you would get from Robert Kiyosaki. The playing field is
like getting a condensed version of The Creature From Jekyll Island. Overall, I
think the book helped me talk more about finances in our marriage. Even if those
conversations are uncomfortable, they need to happen to help us get on the same
page.

## Biggest Flop

I added the Alchemist to the list when someone mentioned they were reading it
again and it was one of their favorite books. I listened to it on a road trip to
Washington. I found it very boring and when it was over, my only thought was,
"That was stupid." Sorry if you're a fan of the book. I'm not.

## Longest Book

My wife was on a Brandon Sanderson kick this summer. I prefer non-fiction books.
We listened to Mistborn on a long road trip to Denver and back and it still took
us a few extra days to finish it. It was good, but I wasn't ready to move on to
the next book.

## Most Recommended Book

I'm a big John Sarno fan. His book, The Mindbody Prescription, gave me my life
back. When I recommend it to people they will often say something like, "It
makes sense, but what do I do now?" Now, if someone is dealing with chronic
pain, I will recommend The Great Pain Deception. It goes into a lot more detail
with an exhaustive list of ailments that can be cured with a mindbody approach.

## New Ideas

Notice I read two books on financial fasting. I liked the idea and tried it out.
It went well. It helped me be more mindful of the things I casually spend money
on. It led to some good financial conversations. That is the beauty of having
this reading goal. When I have an idea, or hear of an idea, I look for books on
the topic to gain insights.

## Most Inspiring

I would say the book that led me to change my daily habits the most was the
Miracle Morning. It started a pattern of getting up earlier and doing some
meditation, journaling and study. I had gotten lazy and this book was the kicker
to get me up and going earlier. Did it last? For a few months. But I plan on
reading it again for hopefully another surge of motivation!

## Most Interesting

I had purchased The Dorito Effect a few years ago when a friend mentioned
something from the book. But I never actually got around to reading it until
this year. I was surprised by how much our food has changed over the years. I
always thought chicken was chicken. I had no idea that it used to be smaller and
more flavorful. It reminded me of the time I shot a couple of quail and ate them
for dinner back when I was a teenager in high school. They were so small, yet so
delicious - so much so that I have never forgotten the experience. Reading this
book made me wonder if this is how chicken used to taste before the emphasis was
on breeding chickens that grew very large, very fast. There were several
interesting changes described in the book and it has slowly led to me wanting to
grow and harvest more of my own food.

## The Unexpected Surprise

When I ordered Financial Fitness on Amazon, they sent me the wrong book. Instead
they sent me another book by Chris Brady titled PAiLS. Rather than returning it,
I decided to read it. I really got into it. It triggered some old
entrepreneurial feelings in me and made me want to leave more of a legacy in
this life. Receiving this book was what Bob Ross would call a "Happy Accident".

## Classics

I re-read a couple of Russell Brunson's books again as I started working on
EnvelopeBudget again. Russell started a new company this year called Success
Secrets. By joining I received a few books by Napoleon Hill. I got absorbed in
these books at the end of the year. These were slower, more deliberate reads,
but I really loved reading his works and I will read them again in the future.

## That's a wrap

I could talk about each book individually but for my benefit and yours, I'll
wrap it up here. Hopefully this will give some of you some ideas for books to
read and perhaps some added motivation and inspiration for 2024!
