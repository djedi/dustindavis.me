For about [9 years now](/blog/python-irc-bot-using-twisted-rollbot), I have been
"Rebecca Rolling" co-workers. I'm always looking for a new trick or opportunity
to slide a Friday video link naturally into a conversation.

If you've never watched Rebecca Black's Friday video, do yourself a favor and

Back in 2011, I'm sure it was the most disliked video on YouTube. It now hits

Rebecca Roll'd me with the following video:
